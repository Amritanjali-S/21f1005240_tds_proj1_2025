Hello,

I submitted my graded assignment for TDS course. But unfortunately I did not
see the question in the portal asking if I have seen all questions and
attended the exam. Can someone please clarify if it shall be graded still?

![Here is a description of the image:

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web page, likely related to an online course or assessment. It has a red header bar that indicates the end date and time: "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST".

Below the header, there's a light blue box with a message "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse", implying a forum or discussion board associated with the site.

The next section shows the user's login information "You are logged in as 22ds1000103@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." There is also a "Logout" button.

Finally, there's a light green box labeled "Recent saves". This section lists three entries with "Reload" buttons, timestamps, and scores. The entries indicate progress or attempts saved on:
* 1/27/2025, 12:53:12 AM with a score of 9.5
* 1/26/2025, 10:56:03 PM with a score of 10
* 1/26/2025, 10:02:43 PM with a score of 8.5

In summary, the image shows a user's interface with details of their login, recent progress, and access to a discussion forum on an online learning platform.

![The image shows a graded assignment titled "Graded Assignment 1" that is already past its due date (January 26, 2025). It mentions that the final submission will be considered for grading, even if submitted multiple times.

The assignment includes a set of instructions on how to troubleshoot difficulties in accessing the Graded Assignment. These include disabling ad blockers, ensuring cookies are enabled, using Javascript, using Chrome Browser, disabling browser extensions, and avoiding overly aggressive anti-virus software.

It also includes a mandatory instruction: students MUST use their Student ID (e.g., 22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) to complete the Graded Assignment, or their score will not be considered for evaluation.

A multiple-choice question follows: "1) I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it." The options are "Yes" and "No". The image shows that the answer "No" was selected, but it was marked as incorrect, with a score of 0. The accepted answer is "Yes".

[@Muthupalaniappan](/u/muthupalaniappan)

It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal
question.

You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure
you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1
on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for
grading.

Kind regards

Dear Sir,  
I encountered the same issue as mentioned. Could you please confirm whether GA
1 will still be evaluated under this condition, and if we will receive our
actual score based on the last saved submission on the assignment page?



---

sir can you please allow us to submit it . like open the seek portal for a few
mins . because we have worked hard to finished the assignment and all our
hardwork will be in vain … please

**Overall Impression:**

This is a headshot of a man with a warm and approachable demeanor.

**Subject:**

*   The subject is a man with medium skin tone.
*   He appears to be in his late 20s or early 30s.

Hello,  
I accessed the assignment through the provided link and attempted and saved
it. But unfortunately I forgot to submit it on my course LMS. I have put in a
lot of effort to complete this and I scored 9, so I kindly request you to
consider it and provide your clarification on the matter.



---

Respected Sir,  
I made the similar mistake of not selecting a yes on the seek IITM portal  
According to your previous replies, does it imply that only the answers
submitted through the link provided will be considered for evaluation
regardless of the seek portal selection for this time?  
Thanks



---

[@23f2005471](/u/23f2005471)

Correct! Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga
page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you
were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it).

Kind regards

Respected Sir/Madam,

I have submitted the TDS GA 1 assignment but failed to submit the Yes or NO
option in the checkbox  
I request you to please consider my submission as I have scored 6/10 marks in
the assignment  
and if you won’t my whole efforts will be lost just because of this

Dear [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir,  
For the TDS week 1 assignment, I have submitted it in the link (this link)
that was mentioned in the graded assignment but I did not submit yes in the
portal tab. Can you please help me out this one time??

I will make sure I submit it in both places next time.

I kindly request you to help me out this one time, as this will really impact
my grade particularly as of this course.  
I got a total of 9.5 in this assignment but as you can see in the image
attached below I erred up with this submission

hi  
even i have faced the same issue

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) I had made my submission for GA1
on the website and also secured 9/10, image attached as shown. But in the
course dashboard i missed out on the trivial step of clicking Yes. Since i am

can iT PLEASE be considered for evaluation.

![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR and visual elements:

**Context:**

The image is a screenshot of a digital form related to an online assignment or quiz. The user seems to have encountered a problem with submitting their work.

**Elements Visible:**

*   **Submission Scores:** At the top, there are records of several attempts, showing scores of 9, 8.5, and 8, with timestamps from January 26, 2025. This indicates multiple attempts at the assignment.
*   **User Request:** The user has written a message indicating they saved their score but forgot to click "yes" on the other portal, and is requesting to have their submission evaluated.
*   **Important Notice:** A line in all caps says the user *must* use their student ID to do the assignment, or the score won't be considered.
*   **Question and Answer:**
    *   A question "I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it".
    *   Radio buttons for "Yes" and "No" answers
*   **Feedback:**
    *   "No, the answer is incorrect."
    *   Score: 0
    *   Accepted Answers: Yes

**Interpretation:**

The user completed the assignment, achieving scores, but apparently missed a crucial final step ("clicking yes") on the portal. The form shows the user answered the question "I have seen the Graded Assignment 1..." with "No", which is incorrect, leading to a score of 0. The accepted answer to this question is "Yes". The user is now trying to explain their mistake and request that the assignment be graded despite the error.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/a/1/a19db9b2ea7ddf2313099689f75e46080efce62e_2_617x500.png)

Your scores will be pushed to the Dashboard from your saved submissions.
Ignore the seek Portal result (that was a placeholder question to make

The image shows a course card for "Tools in Data Science". The top portion of the card has a dark reddish-brown background with a subtle pattern of small dots. The title "Tools in Data Science" is displayed in white text, with "REPEAT FULL COURSE" written underneath, also in white. The bottom part of the card, separated by a horizontal line, reads "Week 1 Assignment - 72.50". This suggests it may be an assignment grade.

Hi Yogesh,

There is no discrepancy, your last submission _before_ the deadline was on
22nd Jan 8:14 pm. You scored 7.25, exactly as mentioned in your recent saves.

The higher score was on the 27th of Jan _after_ the deadline.

Kind regards
