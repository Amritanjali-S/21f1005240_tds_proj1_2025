Please post any questions related to [Project 1 - LLM-based Automation
Agent](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/project-1).

Deadline: Sunday, February 16, 2025 6:29 PM

**Update on 27 Jan 2025** :

A _sample_ evaluation script for Project 1 tasks A1-A10 is available at
[tools-in-data-science-public/project-1 at tds-2025-01-project-1-wip ·
sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public ·
GitHub](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-
public/tree/tds-2025-01-project-1-wip/project-1)

You can use this to validate your code for Project 1.

Please note:

  1. This is a sample. It **WILL** change.
  2. Don’t rely on the dataset being the same. It **WILL** change.
  3. LLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure: 
     * Your code gives correct results _reliably_ (i.e. try a few times)
     * Change the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations
  4. Your [AI Proxy usage](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month.
  5. For those who [submit their code](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOaljgV-INdbKrPotV9OMUKV01QVaFEfcnr5dAxBZqM4x37g/viewform?usp=dialog) by Friday 31 Jan, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.

sir [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) after editing line 127 in datagen.py i got those
required data files. is it allowed ? also i had to run datagen.py MANUALLY(is
this process also should be automatic)?



![Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a line of text that appears to be a step in a set of instructions. The text reads:

"A1. Install uv (if required) and run"

Followed by a URL:

"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/datagen.py"

Then it states:

"with ${user.email} as the only argument. (NOTE: This will generate data files required for the next tasks.)"

It suggests that the user should install "uv" (if needed) and execute a Python script downloaded from the given URL. The script requires the user's email address as an argument. The note indicates that this script generates data files that will be used in subsequent tasks.

Hi Guddu ,

I didn’t make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what
is need of making changes ?

command that I used :  
`uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data`

here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data.
by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating
system.

Kind regards  
Jivraj

getting this issue :

    
    
    openai.AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}

Hi Aishik,

Pls add context to your query, without that we won’t be able to understand,
where exactly you are facing problem.

Possible reasons for this issue:

  1. Not using anand sir’s proxy url for sending requests.
  2. Token not being correct.

yes I was not setting the base url to the proxy. I have fixed it thank you .

While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in
the phrase “recent log file”, mentioned under task A5, in the problem
statement. This confusion arises because there are no dates corresponding to
the log files. Should I consider log-0 as the most recent one? or the
log-<largest_number> file? Please clarify.

do we have to do these tasks in the linux? As in some of the GA1, the linux
answers only accepted. Please tell me that, do we can do it in the desktop or
we have to use linux?  
[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

The bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run
those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the
WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with.

For more information watch this video
<https://youtu.be/q74CP4fB7cY?si=M_zw8WzpmMCyVQat> or watch TDS Live Sessions.

Project 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not
very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are:  
Deliverables,  
and _an example_ of the Evaluation has been provided.  
If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is
considered.  

[![Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am](https://europe1.discourse-

"Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am")

Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.

So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to
the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It
should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work
anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you
achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container
according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this
crucial test.

Kind regards



![Here's a description of the image, breaking down its content:

**Overall Layout:**
The image appears to be a screenshot of a document or webpage outlining the requirements for a coding assignment or project.  It's structured with sections for "Deliverables" and "Evaluation", and includes a "Note" section with important instructions.  Arrows point to the start of the "Deliverables" and "Evaluation" sections.

**Deliverables Section:**

*   **Heading:** "Deliverables" with an arrow pointing towards the list.
*   **List of Tasks:**  A bulleted list of tasks that need to be completed. These tasks include:
    *   Creating a new GitHub repository.
    *   Adding an MIT LICENSE file.
    *   Writing and testing code, using `POST /run?task=...` and `GET /read?path=...`
    *   Committing and pushing code.
    *   Creating a Dockerfile.
    *   Publishing the Docker image to Docker Hub.
    *   Ensuring the Docker image runs using `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000` and serves the API endpoints.
    *   Submitting the GitHub and Docker image URLs in a Google Form. The format of the URLs is given.

**Note Section:**

*   **Heading:** "Note:"
*   **Instructions:**
    *   Use the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable.  It emphasizes **NOT** committing the token to the repository. It suggests setting the environment variable using `os.environ["AIPROXY_TOKEN"]` in the script.
    *   Details about a $1 limit on the AI Proxy token, and instructions to ask the TDS team for more if needed.
    *   Specifies to use the GPT-4o-Mini model.
    *   Advises keeping prompts short and concise, and that `/run` and `/read` calls must complete within 20 seconds.

**Evaluation Section:**

*   **Heading:** "Evaluation" with an arrow pointing towards the word. This indicates that the document likely goes on to explain how the completed project will be assessed.

**Overall Impression:**

The image provides a set of clear instructions for a programming assignment that involves coding, version control (GitHub), containerization (Docker), and interacting with an API using an AI Proxy token. It contains crucial information about securely handling the AI Proxy token and staying within usage limits.

Hi [@Divya1](/u/divya1) ,

There won’t be any project1 page such as GA1s, there is a google form(which
can be found in same page) which needs to be filled after you do project1.

Hi [@23f2005325](/u/23f2005325) ,

Extracting details from credit cards is sensitive, try using strong prompts or
take code from LLM and execute it in script.

Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also
discuss how to use docker as a virtual environment using maybe ollama(local
llm as now there is deepseek opensource, i doubt we would need to use openai
for testing, just for production(test submission) would be enough) and also
some agent(langchain, autogen, crewai) just a quick how-to on setting up and
problems while setting up if possible

More resources on docker. Using docker as a virtual environment. Editing and
executing code in Dockerfiles (like when you change code in src a web
framework automatically reloads page(hot reload)), something along the lines
of this .

> Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also

In Tuesday’s(21 January) session we had discussed docker towards ending of
session.  
What was discussed in that live session regarding docker:

  1. Search for existing containers on repositories such as dockerhub.
  2. Pull an existing docker image.
  3. Run that image inside a container.
  4. Enter to that container and modify something(such as installing python inside a ubuntu container, for customization or create some file)
  5. Once done you can commit it.
  6. And push customized container’s image to docker hub.

Regarding local models running for project1, it’s a good idea, we will see if
it’s possible to discuss in session.



![Here's a description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a cropped portion of an anime or manga-style illustration. The main subject appears to be a character wearing a straw hat. Part of their face is visible, showing dark hair and eyes. One hand is raised, possibly in a greeting or action pose.

**Style:**

The art style is consistent with anime and manga illustrations. The colors are bright and vibrant. The background seems to be a solid color.

**Overall Impression:**

It looks like a stylized and cheerful depiction of a character from a Japanese-style animation or comic. Based on the iconic straw hat, the character is most likely Monkey D. Luffy from the popular anime and manga series "One Piece".

We had a session on 28th Jan introducing all the important aspects of Project.

If you do not do everything exactly as mentioned **especially the pre -
requisites** mentioned in the Evaluation section you will get 0 in the project
and _there will be no appeal_ for failing to meet the pre - requisites of the
evaluation criteria.

In order for us to evaluate the project you have to provide the deliverables
mentioned above.

**Subject:** Request to Add Instructors to Private GitHub Repo

**Message:**  
_"Dear [Instructors’ Names],_

_I’ve set up the environment and dependencies for the project and was
wondering if it would be appropriate to add you to my private GitHub
repository. I’d appreciate any guidance on improving performance, scalability,
and design principles. Please let me know if this is feasible or if there’s a
more suitable way to seek feedback. Apologies if this request is out of
scope._

_Thank you for your time!_

_Best,_  
[Your Name]"*

![Here's a description of the image:

**Overall Impression:** The image is a close-up portrait of a man with a serious and somewhat contemplative expression.

**Physical Description:**

*   **Man:** The subject is a light-skinned man.
*   **Hair:** He has dark hair that appears to be thinning on top, styled somewhat to the side.
*   **Eyes:** He wears glasses with thin frames.
*   **Expression:** His gaze is directed slightly upwards and to the side, giving him a thoughtful or skeptical look. His mouth is closed and the line of his jaw is pronounced.
*   **Clothing:** He's wearing a light-colored collared shirt or jacket. The collar is visible.

**Background and Lighting:**

*   **Background:** The background is a solid, warm brown color.
*   **Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, with the light source seemingly coming from the upper left of the image.

**Overall Impression:** The image has a formal, perhaps slightly dated, feel. The subject's expression and the close-up framing create a sense of intensity and introspection.

For A6, /data/docs/ has subfolders with .md files from which we have to
extract the heading level 1’s (#) right? Apparently there are few files with
different content but the same name. Can someone confirm the same? If yes how
to address these files [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

Hi [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382),

Yes datagen.py must be present in same directory from where you are executing
evaluate.py.

Oh, You trying to use crewai locally for Project1  
kind regards



---

Hi [@JoelJeffrey](/u/joeljeffrey) ,

Filepath is unique for every file, which needs to be inserted to json file.



---

Ok. So just to confirm, since there are files with the same name, the json
file should map the filepath and not the filename to the title right?

problem here??  
please do a live session of complete project process with one or two tasks if
possible

**Visual Elements:**

*   The image shows a classic red and white target, like one used for darts or archery. The target has concentric circles, alternating in red and white.
*   A blue dart is stuck in the target, appearing to be close to the center.

**Overall Impression:**

*   The image conveys the concept of accuracy, hitting the mark, achieving a goal, or targeting something successfully.

Hi Guddu,

We are planning several project sessions in order to show the workflow of
creating a successful project.

Although you are returning a 200 ok, the get request file must match the
expectation. In other words after running the first task for example, has the
new format.md been formatted correctly and matches the expected output.

In this case you would write out the the `expected` variable in the
`evaluate.py` and see if `result` variable matches the `expected`. Then you
can figure out what went wrong.

Kind regards



---

Ok sir  
But please try to take those sessions sooner  
Because it’s taking too much time for me to do any problem(plus two more
courses and one oppe you know) .so I just want to build the project before
deadline.

Please give the date, time and agenda also please.

the model keeps wrong answer, it says uvicorn for uv and has no info on how to
run uv even after explicitly giving instructions(basically an older model) ,
basic “ls” command is also wrong, among other things. You can check your logs
with respect to my api key.  
Do you think we could access a better model?

Maybe Download Deepseek 70b or even 671b and create an api while y’all run the
model locally, in the long it would be cheaper for the course?  
because the model doesn’t know basic commands after telling how to do it.  
So if the model gives us wrong commands 2/3 times then how would we even solve
the question.  
I spent a week on this just saying

can we have the code for this session please?  
[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)



![Here is a description of the image:

The image is a stylized illustration with a flat, geometric design featuring various data science tools and visualizations. The color palette is predominantly composed of teal, navy, peach, and a burnt orange hue, lending a retro, yet modern feel.

At the center, the words "TOOLS IN DATA SCIENCE" are displayed in a prominent, bold font and a burnt orange color, making it the focal point. The words are centrally positioned on a dark navy blue background.

The image contains various visual representations of data science tools and concepts. These include:
*   Charts and graphs (bar charts, line graphs, pie charts)
*   A laptop screen with code or data snippets
*   Stylized tools such as magnifying glasses, pencils, and rulers
*   Network diagrams representing data connections
*   A lock symbol, possibly symbolizing data security
*   A globe icon, representing global data or networking

i need some help can you send me your repo?

Hello, I recently started working on the project. I understood how to do all
the phase A tasks on a high level but I’m struggling to start the
implementation of the first task in phase A. I’m confused mainly about how the
/data directory is supposed to be created, I don’t know how to generate the
data and a little confused about the output formats. I would appreciate if I
could get in contact with anyone who could guide me in the right direction.

Hello everyone, [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
I had a few queries regarding the project;

  1. I am preloading my docker image with uv and generating the /data files when the container is ran. For task A1, I am automating my server to remove the /data directory that’s already present and run datagen.py again. Is this fine?
  2. For /read endpoint, is there a standard for parameters like “path=/data/format.md” or the parameter could be a plain english sentence like “path=show the data in format.md”?
  3. Are we concerned about what’s shown on the console if I run a /run command as long as it gets the job done?
  4. For tasks A1-10, are the file paths provided in the project doc standard or even they’re flexible? Ex. “Count the number of Wednesdays in file /data/format.md, and write just the number to /data/out.txt”

Dear Sir,  
Can we have a mentorship program for TDS for those who have no experience in
programming like me ?  
thanks & regards.

For Project-1 to complete, it requires:  
"You MUST complete ALL these 3 steps to get a score. Failure to do so will
result in getting 0 in the project. If you do not do ALL these 3 steps before
the deadline, there will be no appeal available.  
• Fill the form that is on the Project Page  
But I did not get the form; where is it? While I checked inside the project
pages also.

![Here's a description of the image, focusing on the key elements:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of an online course or documentation page for a subject called "Tools in Data Science." It's divided into two main sections:

*   **Left Sidebar (Navigation):** Lists various topics related to data science, including tools, development, deployment, large language models, and specific projects.
*   **Main Content Area (Right):** Focuses on "Deliverables" for "Project 1" within the "Phase B: Handle Business..." section.

**Key Elements and Content:**

*   **Project Deliverables:** The main content area outlines the steps or tasks required to complete the project. These include:
    *   Creating a GitHub repository and pushing code.
    *   Creating a Dockerfile and publishing the Docker image.
    *   Ensuring the image runs properly via `podman`.
    *   **Most importantly, submitting the GitHub repository URL and Docker image name through a Google Form.** The URL for the Google Form, specifically intended for submitting the URL of your GitHub repository, is given: (https://github.com/user-name/repo-name).

*   **Important Notes:** The page provides several critical notes related to:
    *   Using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable.
    *   Using the Al Proxy token with a $1 limit.
    *   Sticking to the GPT-4o-Mini model.
    *   Keeping prompts concise.

**Visual Cues:**

*   Red arrows and dots highlight the specific item "Submit in this Google Form the URL of your GitHub repository."
*   Star icons at the top and bottom frame "Deliverables" and "Evaluation".

**In summary, the image presents a structured overview of project deliverables, highlighting the submission of a GitHub repository URL via a Google Form. It also provides important instructions and context for using specific tools and models within the project.**](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/9/2/9286f3dcf5984d514cf6a40996bd5040f5d9c306_2_642x500.png)

even after installing python 3.13  
Someone please help

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir, I see that the project 1 timeline was changed from
February 7 - 17, 2025 to January 17 - February 15 which undoubtedly is a good
increase in duration. However, I have my GATE DA exam on Feb 15 and the exam
center is unexpectedly far. So, I request you to consider pushing the deadline
to at least Feb 16. If not, I’ll still do my best.

Hello! [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)

Is the proxy server down right now?  
I am getting this error when I am accessing the endpoint:

{‘id’: ‘chatcmpl-Axq55TzulOVjHYuXYIhkRQzCC3PNl’, ‘object’: ‘chat.completion’,
‘created’: 1738824915, ‘model’: ‘gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18’, ‘choices’:
[{‘index’: 0, ‘message’: {‘role’: ‘assistant’, ‘content’: …, ‘costError’:
‘crypto.createHash is not a function’}

Or, do I have to install crypto module?



---

[@21f3002390](/u/21f3002390) \- AI Proxy is working and you _did_ get the
result. You can ignore any `costError`. It won’t happen in the future anyway.

**What’s happening?** I was trying to generate a unique hash for each request,
as a precursor to caching requests. But I made a mistake in the code.
Specifically, `crypto.createHash` is not supported in CloudFlare. [I fixed
that](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy/commit/5943b6d355deffff88ac07d17aa0c6969cacc3d5)
by removing this. I’ll introduce caching later if required.

For the question #A8 on recognizing the credit card number in the image, Open

![Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a console output or log from a system performing a task involving extracting a credit card number from an image using a Large Language Model (LLM).

**Here's a breakdown:**

1.  **Task Description:** The image indicates a task where a credit card number is to be extracted from an image located at `/data/credit_card.png`.  The extracted number should be written without spaces to a file named `/data/credit-card.txt`.

2.  **HTTP Request (POST):** There is an HTTP POST request to `http://localhost:8000/run`. The query string of this request indicates that the request contains a task.

3.  **HTTP Response (200 OK):** A successful HTTP 200 response indicates the task was received and processed.  The response body is JSON and specifies a function called `extract_numbers_from_image`. The arguments to this function specify the input file path (`/data/credit_card.png`) and the output file path (`/data/credit-card.txt`).

4.  **HTTP Request (GET):** An HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/credit-card.txt` is made to read the contents of the output file.

5.  **Result:** The output file, `/data/credit-card.txt` shows that the expected credit card number was `4026399336539356`, but the actual result was `402639933635936`. There appears to be a mismatch.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/e/a/eab0a8c362c564a00917bb033bce6ad5ba40d103.png)

A query regarding the task description in the query given to LLM for phase A.

For task A3, we have been asked to count wednesdays and the python file
corresponding to A3 does count for wednesday alone. However the example says
the LLM might be asked to count Sundays or other days. Should we be modifying
task A3 code? Or was that just an example and only Wednesdays would need to be
counted?



---

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) Please respond .



---

When will the project session be held? If I have missed it, can I get the
recording?

[@carlton](/u/carlton)



---

Tuesday is when we are currently planning a project session.

Kind regards



---

Tasks in Phase A are defined but that does not mean it has to do one precise
thing. If that was the case then there is no use for an LLM.

Your application should be able to take parse the input and be able to run
commands that do similar things in parameterised fashion. It could be
Wednesdays or Sundays or it might be in Arabic days or anything. So coding to
precisely do something very specific is not the goal.

The program has to be intelligent to do a certain type or class of tasks.

We had a session introducing project. Week 3 session 1. But we will have a
more hands on session on Tuesday.

Kind regards

the last date of project submission is gonne get extended?

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Will there be evaluation script for tasks in group B
also?

Some questions about ‘B’ group tasks:

Q1: For the following tasks (B5, B7, B9, and B10) tasks, how will input files
be provided? Will it be URL or will `datagen.py` also generate files for
these?

Q2: For the above tasks as well as for B6 ( Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a
website), how should output be returned?

Q3: In task B8, for transcribing audio file, which Python package is
recommended or do we need to use OpenAI API?

B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database  
B7. Compress or resize an image  
B8. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file  
B9. Convert Markdown to HTML  
B10. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data

its expecting to match every single detail in that even " and ’ .  
in that case changing evaluate.py will result in zero or less marks.  
llm will only handle -calling function based on query and parameter . What is
it going to do about the logic of functions.

Sorry, sir, not trying to be rude, but there isn’t a single full-fledged

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir I request you demonstrate atleast few tasks, I
spent last 2 days trying to implement but din’t reach anywhere, its really
demotivating sir.

Can you please demonstrate it by just doing One task or provide sample example
code of 1 similar task in the way you explained here. It will be very helpful
right now it is very confusing.

We will be doing project session on ~~Tuesday 9 Feb~~ [correction] Tuesday
11th of Feb (thanks [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382) [@23f2000237](/u/23f2000237))
. Project 1 uses the things you learnt in week 1-3. But mostly week 2 & 3.

We dont do it in the beginning, (but introduced it 2 weeks ago in a live
session), to give students chance to practise the new learnings from week 2 &
3.

The plan has always been to demonstrate a few tasks and have you try doing the
rest.

> **Update: 27 Feb 2025** :

Sir, does this mean 27th is submission deadline?



![Here's a description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a headshot of a middle-aged man with short, dark hair and glasses. He has a serious expression and is looking slightly to the side and upward. The lighting and background suggest a professional or studio setting.

**Specific Details:**

*   **Person:**
    *   **Gender:** Male
    *   **Age:** Appears to be in his 40s or 50s
    *   **Hair:** Short, dark, and neatly styled
    *   **Eyes:** Visible behind glasses
    *   **Facial Features:** A narrow face, a slightly prominent nose, and a somewhat serious or contemplative expression
    *   **Glasses:** Wearing glasses with a thin frame
    *   **Clothing:** Wearing a light-colored shirt or jacket, possibly a suit jacket.
*   **Background:** The background is a solid, warm brown color. It is slightly out of focus, which emphasizes the subject.
*   **Lighting:** The lighting is soft and even, casting gentle shadows on the man's face.

Overall, the image suggests a professional portrait, possibly for a business or academic profile.](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/s.anand/48/15264_2.png)

Hi Aindree,

No its a typo (and will be corrected soon). In the context of what was written
it clearly means it was _updated_ on 27th January. The update being that the
evaluation.py file was provided so that you could test your code against it.

Thanks for bringing it to our attention.

Kind regards

Hi

This would be only for a selected few questions right because say for the
credit card question, where the LLM is involved, to get the card number
itself, we have to give a fine-tuned and strong query.



---

Try using the eval() function, that seemed to work for me



---

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) Sir, could
you please share some guidance on the above?



---

[@jivraj](/u/jivraj),[@carlton](/u/carlton)  
I have done the a1 to a10 task and tried querying through localhost and its
working fine basically all these ten steps but dont know whether its enough or
not. also steps in phase B i am confused that should we create separate
endpoints for these tasks or should it be with same /run endpoint and query.
then will the input be random by any user. what about the output . where
should it be given. phase b needs more explanation.



---

At what time will the session be happening tomorrow sir can you please give
the details?

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Facing some issues in running my project. Taking an example of the Phase A -
A3 task.

I am able to read my files through the GET/read/data/dates.txt query.  
I am also able to use the count_wednesdays function through the POST/run
task/count_wednesdays.

But when I am entering a query such as “count_wednesdays in data/dates.txt” I
am unable to get a response.

Hi Andrew,

You have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well
structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways
of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy.

I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy
and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of
what prompts will be sent to your application.

**In other words getting 10/10 in`evaluate.py` does NOT guarantee 10/10 or
even 5/10 or 1/10 in the real evaluation.**

So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict
interpretation of `evaluate.py`. It has always been meant to give you a feel
for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the
general _idea_ of the task.

That said, `evaluate.py` is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A
tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will
still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some
clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight
forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application). Some of the tasks will be
given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict
interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).

Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A
more robust to a stronger evaluation.)

**A word of caution:** _(i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone
recommendation)_ Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not
execute a task (_possibly your first task_) within 20 seconds (on our server)
then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible
way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image
footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big
we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images
automatically.

Kind regards

Respected [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) and
[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) ,

Is anyone actively monitoring the Discourse page? I have been raising this
issue for the past few days, but there has been no response. Does this mean
the TAs are not addressing students’ concerns?

I am encountering the following error while running my project with these LLM
endpoints:

  * **<https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions>**
  * **<https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings>**

This issue is blocking my progress, and I urgently need assistance to resolve
it. Kindly provide guidance or suggest a solution at the earliest.

Looking forward to your response.

Thanks,  
Telvin Varghese

Hi,  
I am not able to understand how to do the Project 1. The date is also very
near.

The problem I am facing is, When I did the Modules the page was different, but
now in the Project 1 I am not getting any section to submit the project.

Please let me know where are the questions and how tot submit that.  
The deadline is near.

This where I need help, i tried doing with agentic framework but i failed with
the model in llm proxy, which was highly suspect because, that model should
have known what the uv framework but it seemed to me to be outdated. Hence
executing code Interpreter tools failed as the model gave outdated code. I
have raised this issue before

Hence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution
and it was quite robust.

I just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks
you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would
query the agent llm(ie our project). This general function is what i need help
with. Please kindly do the needful.

Hi Telvin

You have run out of tokens. Thats what the message is saying. You ran out 3
days ago. It was clearly mentioned that the limit is $1. You have exceeded $2.

"Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 3.36.50 pm")

In our current internal build of project 1, we have yet to exceed $0.50

As to whether it can be renewed is something we have still not yet decided,
because the question you have raised equally would apply to everyone. Raising
it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by
$1600+ _(i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs)_ for us!

The budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the
BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of
responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the
problem first and then respond.

In short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our
sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a
resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email.

Kind regards



![The image is a screenshot of a webpage titled "Large Language Models" from the website tds.s-anand.net. The webpage appears to be part of a larger set of resources called "Tools in Data Science".

The content of the page discusses the practical usage of large language models (LLMs) and indicates that using LLMs incurs a cost. It specifically states that API keys have been created for individuals with an "iitm.ac.in" email address for using models like "gpt-4o-mini" and "text-embedding-3-small", with a usage limit of $1 per calendar month. It warns users not to exceed this limit.

The page then provides instructions on using an "AI Proxy" instead of OpenAI, with specific steps for replacing the API and API key.

The navigation sidebar on the left shows categories such as "Tools in Data Science," "Development Tools," and "Deployment Tools," with "Large Language Models" currently selected. The sidebar also lists various related topics like "Prompt engineering," "TDS TA Instructions," "TDS GPT Reviewer," and others.

At the bottom of the page, there are links to the previous and next pages, titled "Local LLMs: Llamafile" and "Prompt engineering," respectively.

Thanks for your response, [@Carlton](/u/carlton). It seems I won’t be able to
proceed with the project until this issue is resolved. Also, I haven’t used
LLM so much until February 7th to cost $2.



---

Every request you send, gives you a response back with exactly how much that
request cost. So you can track your usage.



---

I’m aware of that. I’ve mostly noticed a cost of $0.0003 per request, so I
haven’t been tracking my total monthly expenses. Moving forward, I’ll keep a
record of the cost for each request. Also, do strong prompts impact the
overall cost?

![Here's a description of the image you provided:

**Overall Structure:**

The image appears to be a tutorial or a code snippet demonstrating how to store and retrieve documents from a vector embedding database. It's divided into two parts: "Step 1" which is not visible, and "Step 2: Retrieve".

**Step 1 (Not visible):**

The first part describes how to store each document in a vector embedding database. It has Python code using the ollama library for embedding documents and storing them.

**Step 2: Retrieve**

*   **Title:** "Step 2: Retrieve"
*   **Description:** The text below the title mentions that the following code will retrieve the most relevant document based on an example prompt.
*   **Code:**
    *   Example input is, "What animals are llamas related to?".
    *   The code generates an embedding for the input prompt using `ollama.embed` (similar to Step 1).
    *   It then uses `collection.query` to find the most relevant document based on the generated embedding.
    *   The top result is extracted and assigned to the `data` variable.

**Code Snippets:**

The code snippets are in Python and involve the following libraries/techniques:

*   `ollama.embed`: Likely a function to generate vector embeddings of text.
*   Vector embedding database usage (possibly using a library like ChromaDB, Pinecone, etc. but not explicitly stated).
*   Cosine similarity based retrieval (inferred from the general context).

**Overall:**

It's a practical example showing how to use embeddings to perform semantic search or information retrieval, finding documents most similar to a given query.

![The image shows a graphic design featuring an array of colorful icons related to data, technology, and design. At the top, there are icons depicting a compass, colored pencils, a computer monitor, a circuit board, and additional colored pencils. In the central area, there are various graphs, charts, a globe, and other interconnected icons. At the bottom, there are more abstract geometric designs and pie charts.

Superimposed in the center of the image is a large, dark blue rectangular shape with rounded corners. On this shape, the words "Week 5" and "SESSION 1" are written in a large, bold, white font.

_For task A2_ :

  * **A2**. Format the contents of `/data/format.md` using `prettier@3.4.2`, updating the file in-place

I am getting the following error:  
`🔴 A2 failed: Command '['npx', 'prettier@3.4.2', '--stdin-filepath',
'/data/format.md']' returned non-zero exit status 1.`

However, running a **POST request** to
<https://localhost:8000/run?task=Format+/data/format.md+with+prettier+3.4.2>
gives successful output.

`{"success":true,"message":"Formatted and verified successfully!"}% `

Here is my code snippet:

    
    
    def format_file(filepath):
        while True:  # Loop until formatting and verification pass
            try:
                result = subprocess.run(
                    ["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--write", filepath],
                    check=False,  # Don't raise exception automatically
                    capture_output=True,
                    text=True
                )
    
                if result.returncode != 0:
                    return {"success": False, "message": f"Prettier write failed: {result.stderr}"}
    
                if verify_prettier_formatting(filepath):
                    return {"success": True, "message": "Formatted and verified successfully!"}
                else:
                    logging.info("Verification failed. Retrying formatting...") #Log the retry
                    # If verification fails, the loop continues and prettier --write is executed again.
    
            except Exception as e:
                return {"success": False, "message": str(e)}
    
    def verify_prettier_formatting(filepath):
        try:
            subprocess.run(["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--check", filepath], check=True, capture_output=True, text=True) #Capture output
            return True  # File is formatted correctly
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            logging.error(f"Prettier check failed: {e.stderr}") # Log the error from prettier check
            return False  # File is not formatted correctly
    

What am I missing here?

I am getting the same error. Did you find any solution?

Has anyone succeeded in the extraction of credit cards details task? The LLM
seems to consider it as illegal task and if I use pytessaract the docker image
size will become really large. What to do in this case?

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj),

I followed what you taught in Feb 11 session and tried implementing task A1.
My understanding is once i run the subprocess, datagen.py file should be run
and /data folder should be created in the project folder. But it is not
happening to me. I am getting the following error

    
    
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/var/folders/rj/z_3b8hl51558519w90k5hp600000gn/T/datagen4COEF3.py", line 284, in <module>
        os.makedirs(config["root"], exist_ok=True)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      File "<frozen os>", line 227, in makedirs
    OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: '/data'
    

If i can’t automate this process, i don’t see the point writing code for other
tasks. Can anyone help me solving this error?

shell = true in evaluate.py, remove it meaning comment it out, task a2 thats
causing the error

If I am not wrong, both the expected and actual result contain the same
entries. It is just that the ordering is different. The expected result also
doesnt follow any particular format (so does the actual result).

Kindly advise on this [@carlton](/u/carlton)

**EDIT** : Resolved on a later evaluation

For the task - * **B10**. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and
returns JSON data

Do we have to handle prompts for converting CSV to JSON or for writing an
endpoint for doing so?

yeah i am also facing the same doubt

Dear Instructors ([@carlton](/u/carlton), [@iamprasna](/u/iamprasna)):

Confirming, just to be needfully pedantic:

It will **solely** be the responsibility of the Project Evaluator (human or
machine) to parse the correct `AIPROXY_TOKEN` generated against my IITM email
ID (presumably, per some database which holds all such generated
`AIPROXY_TOKEN`s of the students who have generated one); and the correct
`$IMAGE_NAME` (to-be-submitted by myself in the Project Submission Google
Form) in `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p
8000:8000`, correct?

Asking this seemingly obvious question, as (apparently) the actual
`AIPROXY_TOKEN` is not to be included anywhere in the code, or the repository,
or the dockerfile.

I am also facing the same issue, just that the ordering is different.  
Sorting by keys also didn’t help.  
Please help on this [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)

sir will the tasks of Phase A and Phase B change? like currently do we need to
make llm write the code for all tasks dynamically or can we write a pre
defined python code to execute tasks after the llm parses the task and runs
python code

![Here's a description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a medium close-up portrait of a man with a thoughtful or serious expression. The lighting is warm, creating a somewhat intimate atmosphere.

**Details:**

*   **Subject:** A man with fair skin. He appears to be middle-aged, with short dark hair that's slightly receding.
*   **Facial Features:** The man is wearing glasses with a thin frame. His facial expression suggests concentration or concern, with a slight tilt of his head. His lips are pressed together.
*   **Clothing:** He is wearing a light-colored shirt.
*   **Background:** The background is a blurred, warm brown color, which helps to keep the focus on the man's face.
*   **Lighting:** The lighting is soft and diffused, with the main light source coming from the left side of the frame.

In summary, the image is a simple, focused portrait of a man, with a serious and contemplative expression.](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/s.anand/48/15264_2.png)

[@23f2001978](/u/23f2001978)

That error is usually if you are using the wrong endpoint (ie. using open ai
libraries instead of sending requests to aiproxy).

Without seeing the request its hard to tell you what the cause of the error
is.

Kind regards

![Here's a description of the image, focusing on its content and context:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a terminal or code editor output, likely from a process involving code formatting. It seems to be a test or demonstration of using "prettier," a code formatter, on a Markdown file. There is a request and result shown, where the file is supposed to be formatted with prettier.

**Breakdown of the Content:**

1.  **Task Description:** The top line indicates that the task involves formatting the contents of a file named `/data/format.md` using `prettier@3.4.2` and updating the file in place.
2.  **HTTP Request (POST):** A POST request is sent to `http://localhost:8000/run`.  The URL parameters (the `task=...` part) seem to encode instructions for the server to format the Markdown file using Prettier.
3.  **HTTP 200 (OK) Response (POST):**  A 200 OK status code indicates the POST request was successful.  The JSON payload shows the server received the request to `format_file_with_prettier`, targeting `/data/format.md` with `prettier_version: "3.4.2"`.
4.  **HTTP Request (GET):** The code then sends a GET request to read the content of the file at `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/format.md`.
5.  **HTTP 200 (OK) Response (GET):** A 200 OK status code indicates the GET request was successful. This is followed by the contents of the file `/data/format.md`.
6.  **File Content:** The file `/data/format.md` contains the following:
    *   A heading "#Unformatted Markdown"
    *   A paragraph: "This is a sample paragraph with extra spaces and trailing whitespace."
    *   A list with some inconsistencies in formatting (mix of hyphens and plus signs).
    *   An item: "Fourth item"
    *   Python code snippet:
        *   \`\`\`py

![Here is a description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of a code editor, most likely Visual Studio Code, showing Python code. The code defines two asynchronous functions, `a2` and `a3`.

*   **Function `a2`**: This function takes an email string and a file string as input, along with optional keyword arguments. It reads markdown content from the email and then uses the `prettier` tool to format the specified file. It runs `prettier` as a subprocess, passing the original content as input and using the file path as a parameter. After running the formatter, it reads the file again and compares the result to the expected output. If they differ, it calls a `mismatch` function; otherwise, it returns `True`. There are comments, such as `# Ensure npx is picked up from the PATH on Windows`, which suggests the code is concerned about environment compatibility.
*   **Function `a3`**: This function takes an email string and optional keyword arguments. The body of this function is cut off in the picture.
*   **Other elements**:
    *   There are line numbers on the left side of the code.
    *   The code is color-coded for readability.
    *   At the bottom of the image, the editor's bottom bar is visible, showing options like "PROBLEMS," "OUTPUT," "DEBUG CONSOLE," "TERMINAL," and "PORTS."
    * The terminal seems to be open, displaying "arguments:"

running in docker?  
////////////////////////////

Yes, I commented out check=True to see the error

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
could you please help me out on how to start with TDS Project-1, as I am stuck
at the moment and don’t know where to start from. This project is very much
unfamiliar for me and I need some guidance on how to start with it. It would
be really great if you could provide some help through
resources/materials/videos and help me complete the project. Thanks in
advance!



---

then im not sure exactly wait lemme check



---

issue with evaluate py, specifically , how it formats the file, maybe
shell=True should be uncommented if commented out. then im not sure. Im not in
composing docker files yet



---

Could anyone please help me with the project… I am trying to do it but I’m
always getting errors even while starting.



---

My final docker image size is coming 1.25 gb, I am using the ubuntu base image
as I thought it would be appropriate given the tasks. Is it ok with that size?

PS - Also I would be running out of token if I need to test again with some
other base image now.  
[@carlton](/u/carlton)



---

Go through the week 1-3 assignments once, you would be good to go with Phase A
tasks.

[@23f2003413](/u/23f2003413) [@AnvithaV](/u/anvithav)



---

You do not need the whole of ubuntu!

Just python and uv

More like 128mb image.

Please watch Tues week 5 session 1

Kind regards



---

Will there be more live sessions on project ?

[@carlton](/u/carlton)



---

I could pull it down to 610 mb, using python:3.9-slim now, but there are some
essential libraries that is needed which is taking up the space…will it be ok?
I mean installing on the go with uv might lead to timeout during evaluation…



---

How did you corrected it ?



---

I tried cutting it down further but it is affecting the functionality, this is
the best I can do, i.e., 610 mb



---

could you help later, when i need to construct docker image, via gmeet? PLEASE

Sir in main.py file I’m defining task with different variables . But in
evaluate.py tasks are defined by different variables to test and when I’m
testing it using python evaluate.py it returns unsuccessful . I’m testing all
my tasks of main.py with Postman it returns successful.  
My query is that how the tasks get evaluated and do i need to change my
variables in main.py ? And what are the other things i have to change.  
Also plss update evaluate.py fie with phase B tasks

Kind regards



---

Hi instructors and TAs,  
For the different tasks in Phase B, I don’t have a clear idea of what type of
a response you expect.

eg.

  * Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database & Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website & Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - Do you want the query’s response on an output file like A10? or as a response?

I understand that these are broad problems you except us to solve, but it
would be helpful to know what type of response you would require.

Thanks,  
Trebhuvan



---

Hi,  
Pls tell us how to use evaluate.py script to check our codes



---

Output specifications will be detailed in the “task” sent to the endpoint.

Phase B is meant to be vague because if you can solve it, without an elaborate
and gratuitous use of gpt function calling, then you can actually solve _all
tasks using the same function_ !

Kind regards

Okay sure!! Ping me when you require to generate…

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)

will it be ok? Actually I developed it in a way that require some of the
essential dependencies and at this point of time it would be dangerous to
alter the way of handling it as I am running short of AIProxy Token credits.

Earlier when I asked this:

21f2000709:

> Any tentative size cutoff for the docker image?

I could have altered my way of handling dependencies but at that point of time
there was no clear numbers.

I request you to please allow this time around with this size…



![Here's a description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a portrait of a young man. He appears to be in a semi-outdoor setting.

**Details:**

*   **Subject:** A young man with short, dark brown hair. He has a clean-shaven face and appears to be looking directly at the camera.
*   **Clothing:** He's wearing a plaid shirt in shades of blue, grey and black.
*   **Background:** The background is somewhat blurred but seems to include greenery like leaves and foliage. It suggests he might be in a garden or near some plants. There is also what looks like a window frame or architectural detail behind him.
*   **Expression:** The man's expression is neutral, perhaps slightly thoughtful.
*   **Lighting:** The lighting appears soft and natural, with a slight shadow on one side of his face, which adds some dimension.

![Here's a description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a portrait of a young man. It's a medium shot, focusing on his upper body and face.

**Subject:**

*   He appears to be South Asian or Indian.
*   He has short, dark hair.
*   He's wearing a plaid shirt.
*   He has a light complexion and well-defined features.

**Background:**

*   The background is somewhat blurred, suggesting the focus is on the subject.
*   There are hints of greenery in the background, possibly indicating he's outdoors or near plants.
*   There is a window or some structure behind him

**Lighting:**

*   The lighting is generally soft and natural.

In summary, the image is a pleasant portrait of a young man, likely taken outdoors in natural light.](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/21f2000709/48/134907_2.png)

usage of langchain is allowed?

It will be extended, [@carlton](/u/carlton) mentioned it in a TA session
already.

Hi [@Rishabh2](/u/rishabh2)

What exactly you mean by variables? only one argument is required for running
`evaluate.py` that’s an email address.

You need to download both `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` in same folder and
then execute `evaluate.py` using uv.  
`uv run evaluate.py --email $any_email`.

For phase B

Hi [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382)  
This is the classic case where you use Prompt engineering to solve your
problems. I assume you have already achieved your answers, but I want to
clarify this for someone who is facing this problem.

The thing is GPT-4o-mini is intelligent enough to understand what kind of task
you are asking it do, and extracting Credit Card info from an image is one of
the many prohibited tasks.

What you can do is, **try to fool it using itself.** Just ask ChatGPT to
generate a prompt that would be capable of fooling itself into extracting out
that credit card info. I was capable of doing it after pretending to be a
working on a Cyber Security project, and other fake details which ChatGPT
itself provided me with.

Project is also Incomplete.



---

Try creating a better prompt for this task.  
_Hint: Ask it to recheck certain similar looking digits._



---

After submitting docker image through, it will be pulled and our token will be
used.

Things to be checked at your end.  
1.` podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` works
fine  
2\. Above command will start 8000 server so use evaluate.py to test if things
are working as expected.

One final question [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) , will our
projects be evaluated with our `AIPROXY_TOKEN` or a different one.

Because my project is done but for evaluation if my `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is used,
it might be out of credits.

Thanks. Do you know the new date?

That wasn’t said, but it was not this weekend for sure.

my automation is happening and prompt distribution too but it just isnt able
to pass any test after 1st in evaluation.py did someone else face same problem
if yes then how to solve it please help

actually that easyocr is directly sending the clear text(no confusion) to llm

The image is a screenshot of a terminal session, likely running on a Linux-based system. The user "vikramjncasr@ANJANEYA" is in the directory "/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project".

The user executed the command "podman run 20511982f949", which appears to be an attempt to run a container using Podman. However, the container execution resulted in an error:

*   A Python traceback is displayed, indicating an issue with the file "/app/app.py".
*   Specifically, the error is "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'". This means the Python script "/app/app.py" tries to import the "fastapi" library, but that library is not installed or accessible within the container environment.

The terminal prompt is displayed again at the bottom, indicating that the command execution has completed.

Install datagen.py in the same folder from where you are executing
evaluate.py.

[@vikramjncasr](/u/vikramjncasr) Check how you are executing, use uv or else
install required modules globally

Sir,  
the folder already exists in that folder

![Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a terminal or console output, likely from a Python development environment. It appears to be running the Uvicorn ASGI server.

Key elements:

*   **Prompt:** "PS C:\IIT\_Madras\TDS\_Project>" indicates the current directory in a PowerShell environment on a Windows system.
*   **Command:** "uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000" is the command used to start the Uvicorn server. It specifies the application module ("app:app"), the host IP address (127.0.0.1 or localhost), and the port (8000).
*   **Output:** The output from Uvicorn shows that the server started successfully, is running on http://127.0.0.1:8000, and received a "GET" request.
*   **Informational Messages:** The "INFO:" prefixes indicate informational messages from Uvicorn about the server's startup process, including starting and finishing server processes, waiting for application startup, and the application startup completion.
*   **HTTP Request:** A "GET" request to the root path ("/") was successfully handled, returning a "200 OK" status.
*   **CTRL+C:** It also suggests pressing CTRL+C to quit the server.

In short, the image displays the successful startup and operation of a Uvicorn server, likely for a FastAPI or similar Python web application.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/8/58c6872accc838dcec5fda23f4290f5e284dde1e.png)

![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR and visual elements:

**Overall Layout:**

The image shows a split screen. On the left is a Google Chrome browser window. On the right is a VS Code (Visual Studio Code) window.

**Left Side (Chrome Browser):**

*   The browser is displaying a page at the address `http://localhost:5000`.
*   The page content is a JSON error message: `{"detail":"Not Found"}`. This indicates that the API endpoint at the root ("/") is not working or not yet implemented.

**Right Side (VS Code):**

*   The VS Code window is open to a Python file named `app.py`.
*   The file appears to be a FastAPI application.  Key parts:
    *   It attempts to get the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` from environment variables and raises an exception if it's not found.
    *   It defines a root endpoint (`/`) using `@app.get("/")` that returns a JSON response `{"message": "Hello from the Automation Agent!"}`.
    *   It includes imports like `FastAPI`, `HTTPException`, `Query`, `PlainTextResponse`, and `logging`.
    *   There's also code for logging deletion attempts.

*   The VS Code terminal is open at the bottom showing output from running `git push origin main`. This indicates the recent changes in the project have been pushed to the remote repository.
    *  It is running in a WSL Ubuntu environment.

**Summary and Interpretation:**

The image suggests that the developer is building a FastAPI application. They have encountered an error ("Not Found") when trying to access the root endpoint in the browser. This could be because the server isn't running, the route isn't defined correctly, or the application is having problems starting up (missing environment variables). They just pushed the changes to the repository.

![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR output and visual elements:

**Content:**

The image is a screenshot of a terminal window, likely running a Linux or Unix-like operating system (such as macOS or a Linux distribution like Ubuntu).

**Shell Prompt:**

The prompt `vikramjncasr@ANJANEYA:/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project_1$ ` indicates:

*   `vikramjncasr`: The username of the currently logged-in user.
*   `ANJANEYA`:  The hostname of the computer.
*   `/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project_1`: The current working directory.  This suggests that the user is within a directory structure mounted under `/mnt/c`.

**Commands:**

The command executed in the terminal is `ls /`. This command lists the contents of the root directory (`/`).

**Output:**

The output of the `ls /` command shows a standard set of top-level directories commonly found in Unix-like systems:

*   bin
*   boot
*   etc
*   init
*   lib.usr-is-merged
*   lost+found
*   mnt
*   proc
*   run

The image shows a user listing the contents of the root directory of a Linux/Unix-like system through the command line. It displays a common configuration and file structure.

What are implications on missing the project 1.  
Due to some personal reasons I wasn’t able to start any work on my project 1.
It seems difficult for me to complete it.  
Could you please tell what will be the implications of missing it. Will I in
anyway be able to cover up and pass in the subject doing future assignments
and projects?

Thank you

PS: This isn’t any request to extend dates. I accept my fault and respect the

Can we submit project number of times before deadline…

thanks for you feedbacak I have figured it out! Thanks it means a lot…

A silly Doubt though but still a doubt!  
Could we create an image first of our project in initial stage(ie the my
“app.py” is not completely ready) but I have build an docker image including
the app.py and other dependencies.  
Should I give the same url now and then carry on updating the app.py  
Or, Should first complete and then upload in the form!

plz reply!!

Can you send the link for the video on 11th Feb?

How did you resolve the file cannot be found error?

pls help with this error



![The image shows a series of error messages related to a task involving credit card data extraction and processing. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Task Description:** The initial task is to process an image file (`/data/credit_card.png`) containing a credit card number. An LLM (Large Language Model) is supposed to extract the credit card number from the image and save it to a text file (`/data/credit-card.txt`) without any spaces.

*   **HTTP 500 Error:** The first error is an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error, with the message "Error extracting credit card: Image file .C:\\Users\\starb\\Desktop\\tds\_p\_1\\data\\credit\_card.png does not exist." This indicates that the server is unable to find the image file needed for the task. The file path is a Windows path, suggesting the server is running on a Windows system.

*   **HTTP 404 Error:** The second error is an HTTP 404 Not Found, occurring when attempting to read `/data/credit-card.txt`. This indicates that the file, which should have been created by the task, doesn't exist. This is because the previous error prevented the successful completion of the credit card number extraction and writing.

*   **A8 Failed:** "A8 failed: Cannot read /data/credit-card.txt." This confirms that the program could not access the expected output file.

*   **A9 Failed:** The final error involves an attempt to use an OpenAI embeddings API, which returns an HTTP 401 Unauthorized error. This indicates that the authentication credentials for the API are missing or invalid.

In summary, the task failed because the initial image file was not found by the server, and a subsequent attempt to retrieve a result file also failed, and there was a problem accessing OpenAI.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/c/5c040c4323f2d2dfbeb3c76334f44adc7a59343f.png)

Sir, could you please mention the title of youtube videos in which the project
session are covered?



---

Hi,

When yesterday’s recorded video will be uploaded in youtube?



---

Thanks for the prompt reply [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) . I have done the project
setup till whatever was covered on the 11th Feb session. I am not able to
proceed further as I have no clue on how to work on this. Can you please help
me out as it would mean a lot.

![Here's a description of the image:

The image is a stylized title card or introductory slide. It features a background filled with abstract data-related icons (graphs, charts, globes, circuits, pencils). The color palette is bright, with a combination of teal, red, yellow, orange, and navy.

Overlaid on this patterned background is a navy rectangle with rounded corners that obscures the design on either side.  Centered within this rectangle, in large white font, are the words "WEEK 5 SESSION 1". The presentation evokes a modern, informational, and potentially educational theme.

![Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a red play button, likely associated with video playback. It's not a perfectly rendered or high-resolution image, as it appears slightly pixelated or blurry.

Specifically:

*   **Shape:** The button has an elongated octagon-like shape with rounded corners.
*   **Color:** It's primarily red.
*   **Symbol:** A white or light-colored triangular "play" symbol is located in the center.

The general appearance and colors strongly suggest it is a play button icon, similar to what you might find on video players or platforms.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/8/5/85553e6b4edcc2dda60afe0f9f82c7f3dbf31e04.png)


![Here's a description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**
The image is an illustration that seems to represent tools used in the field of data science. It has a bold, geometric style with a limited color palette.

**Central Text:**
The main focus is on the text "TOOLS IN DATA SCIENCE," which is prominently displayed across the middle of the image. "TOOLS" is at the top in yellow. Below that is "IN" and "DATA", and at the very bottom is "SCIENCE" in orange.

**Surrounding Elements:**
The text is surrounded by various geometric shapes and symbols that likely represent different aspects of data science. These include:

*   **Charts and graphs:** A variety of line graphs and bar charts.
*   **Network diagrams:** Representing connections and relationships within data.
*   **Data points connected by lines:** possibly representing machine learning or artificial intelligence.
*   **Abstract shapes:** Rectangles, triangles, circles, and other geometric forms scattered throughout.
*   **A laptop**

**Color Palette:**
The image uses a limited color palette of teal, red, orange, and yellow, creating a cohesive and striking visual style.

**Overall Style:**
The image has a clean, modern, and somewhat retro feel due to the geometric shapes and limited color palette. It would be suitable for use as an infographic, presentation slide, or promotional material related to data science.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/5/05fae46322d62fdfa90a7c47a2011056f549cd9b_2_500x500.jpeg)

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir! Is this video (Week-5 Session-3) the
continuation video from the previous session (Week-5 Session-1), since the
Session-2 video has not been recorded and uploaded. I am totally relying on
these videos to complete the project sir. Please help me out!



---

offical answer is you dont, you let run it in docker and it would apparently
work , im not there yet, bus as of of now , create your docker image and start
testing there

Is someone else are also getting this kind of error messages…  
I have a low end system, then shifted to high one then again this popped up…  
Does anyone know how to come over this…

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)
[@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) sir, I have implemented the code for B3 &
B6 but unfortunately as per the instructions given in project for B3 & B6 —

  * **B6**. Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website

  * **B3**. Fetch data from an API and save it

They are almost similar and it’s getting confusing in both cases, it’s given
output based on B3 and not reading the input for B6, so could you please help
me out with this?

Is anyone else facing this or a similar issue?



---

Two solutions

  1. give proper permissions.
  2. use docker containers this is what we will test on.

I would prefer 2nd approach



---

For B tasks use LLM to write code on the fly and execute it, use better
prompts. In evaluation script detailed task will be provided with what data
needs to be scraped, endpoints, parameters, etc.



---

{‘error’: {‘message’: “Invalid ‘tools[6].function.description’: string too
long. Expected a string with maximum length 1024, but got a string with length
4384 instead.”, ‘type’: ‘invalid_request_error’, ‘param’:
‘tools[6].function.description’, ‘code’: ‘string_above_max_length’},
‘monthlyCost’: 0.08569882000000002, ‘cost’: 0, ‘monthlyRequests’: 82}

i cant send long prompts then what is the point?



---

local llm also we cant use you because you have some limit on file size, we
send long prompt also it doesn’t work xD . What do we do?  
[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)
@anybodywhowouldatleastreplyONCE



---

Hi,  
If you read these questions carefully then they are not similar, one is asking
you to extract data from a webpage, meaning you have to do something related
to the HTML code. And the other is simply sending a request to a given
endpoint.



---

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)
[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) ,  
In task A6  
**Find all Markdown (`.md` ) files in `/data/docs/` . For each file, extract
the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with `# ` ). Create an
index file `/data/docs/index.json` that maps each filename (without the
`/data/docs/` prefix) to its title (e.g. `{"README.md": "Home",
"path/to/large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}` ).**

Here expected output JSON “key” is file name or file path without prefix
/data/docs/ as prompt is bit confusing . when “path/to/large-language-
models.md” is given in example is actually referring to file path or filename
itself is “path/to/large-language-models.md”.



---

This can easily be checked by runing the evaluate.py file.  
Anyways, a file present in data/docs/folder_a/folder_b/md_file should be
folder_a/folder_b/md_file as key.



---

hey [@23f2001975](/u/23f2001975) did you find the solution to this problem ?  
i am facing the exact same issue



---

[@carlton](/u/carlton)  
Sir, my token limit has crossed the $1 limit. Will I receive new limit or a
fresh token ? I still need to complete my project.  
Thank you

For as task description like this

  * Write the # of Thursdays in `/data/extracts.txt` into `/data/extracts-count.txt`

I have given the prompt in such detail to the LLM but it is still not able to
understand the task because of the “#” symbol. The task is getting truncated
even before it reaches to the LLM.  
Can anyone help me on this because I have tried so many things to fix this but
nothing seems to help.

Hi [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj), [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir,

I have created a docker file and run the application but it’s throwing error
for  
A2 task  
No such file or directory: ‘npx’  
Do i need give the node install in docker file?



---

Hash is just another way of writing “number”



---

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
sir i have tried to solve the A1. when I want to check the solution we are
asked for the datagen module as the evaluate.py have  
’

    
    
    ''from datagen import (
        get_markdown,
        get_dates,
        get_contacts,
        get_logs,
        get_docs,
        get_email,
        get_credit_card,
        get_comments,
        get_tickets,
    )
    '''
    

so do we need to download the datagen.py in the local system first…

Or it should be the part of the automation only…



---

I am getting internal server error for task A1, I have been trying for a long
time. It may be possible that i have issues with my ai_proxy token thus tell
how to properly set the taken.



---

Yes I know that but LLM does not know that # indicates number. And no prompt
is fixing this issue because the task has to be passed as query parameter and
by the time LLM reads the task, it is already half gone due to #.



---

Where to find AIProxy token from?



---

what if we are out of token sir how do we complete our project then?



---

could u share your code once i think you should explicitly try to install npx
in your code

![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR and visual cues:

**Content:**

The image shows a code editor window, likely VS Code, with a Python file ("main.py") open. The code defines a function `handle_task_A2` that takes a file path and prettier version as arguments. It checks if the file exists and, if so, uses `subprocess.run` to execute the `prettier` command-line tool (via `npx`) to format the file. If the file does not exist, it raises a `FileNotFoundError`.

Below the code editor, there's a terminal output section. It appears to be showing the "expected" and "result" of some operation, possibly related to the `prettier` formatting.  The expected output contains unformatted Markdown text, and the result shows (identical) Markdown text.  There's also a small Python snippet `print("user@example.com")` included in both the "expected" and "result" blocks.

**Layout:**

*   **Top:** Code editor with Python code.
*   **Middle:** Tabs for "PROBLEMS", "OUTPUT", "DEBUG CONSOLE", "TERMINAL", "PORTS".
*   **Bottom:** Terminal output showing "EXPECTED" and "RESULT" sections, likely related to the `prettier` formatting task.

**In summary,** the image depicts a scenario where a Python script uses the `prettier` tool to format a Markdown file. The terminal output shows the "expected" and "actual" content of the Markdown file before and after formatting, with the formatting appearing unchanged.

okay but in my docker image when i tried to run that in local, its asking for
npx and it doesnt work



---

[@carlton](/u/carlton) could you please give a hint as to why this isnt
working



---

im running locally first and then will use docker when i get a 10/10 score



---

Okay, actually when i tried with local, i’m facing path error

    
    
    ./data/format.md
    [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified
    

So that’s why i moved to docker but there also i’m getting error for A2.



---

you should manually check if the file really exists or not because i think the
code and the folder where datagen.py is downloading files(data folder) are
different



---

yes yes i moved the folder to current working directory



---

If you are using the function calling approach, you could just parse the ‘#’
and change it to ‘number’ and then send the prompt to the llm for that
particular task.

Or another approach is tell the llm,

If you ever see the phrase ‘count the # of’ in a task, please interpret it as
‘count the number of’. For example  
Count the # of Fridays means  
Count the number of Fridays

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) this is showing while docker image
is running



![Here is a description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of a Visual Studio Code window, showing a Python script named "llm.py" and the terminal output from running that script. 

Here's a breakdown of what's visible:

*   **VS Code Window:** The primary focus is the VS Code interface.
*   **File Explorer:** On the left, the "EXPLORER" panel shows the project directory structure. "llm.py" is selected, indicating its content is displayed in the editor. Other files and directories like "__pycache__", "llm\_venv", "a.py", "app.py", "Dockerfile", and "re.txt" are also visible.
*   **Editor Panel (llm.py):** This shows the Python code. Key lines include:

    *   `import subprocess`
    *   `script_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanando/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py'`
    *   `arg = '21f3002277@ds.study.iitm.ac.in'`
    *   `subprocess.run(['wget', script_url, '-O', 'datagen.py'])`
    *   `subprocess.run(['python', 'datagen.py', arg])`
*   **Terminal Panel:** The bottom of the window contains the "TERMINAL" panel, displaying the output from running the Python script. The output suggests:

    *   The script fetches a file using `wget` (likely `datagen.py`).
    *   The script then attempts to run the downloaded file (`datagen.py`) with a provided argument.
    *   There is an error: `NameError: name 'subprocess' is not defined. Did you forget to import 'subprocess'?`

Overall, the image shows a developer working on a Python script ("llm.py") that downloads and executes another Python script ("datagen.py"). The terminal output indicates that the "subprocess" module was used in the external script, which causes an error since subprocess needs to be imported.

in project page, ctrl+F and search ai proxy, one link s.anandProxy or
something, there it will validate you email and get you your token.



---

can you share your code for dynamic code generation, i dont have the base to
start with , can you send me the code?  
whatever this image is , llm_code,oy and etc



---

What file should we have while pushing it to git and making image  
should datagen file and data be there or not?



---

Please read the deliverables and evalute section.

datagen.py and evaluate.py were for only for your testing purposes so that you
have an idea of the workflow and how the evaluation works. They are NOT part
of your project submission.

Only DO what the project page tells you in the deliverables and evalute
sections.

Kind regards

i tried troubleshooting this for hours but no luck could you please tell me
what i did wrong here



![The image displays a Python traceback, indicating an error during the execution of a Python script named "app.py" located in the "/app/" directory.

Specifically, the traceback reveals a "ModuleNotFoundError," stating that there is no module named 'fastapi.' This error occurs on line 11 of the "app.py" file, which contains the statement "from fastapi import FastAPI."

This suggests that the FastAPI library, which is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python, has not been installed or is not accessible within the current Python environment.

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Sir please tell me this I am not using podman i am
using docker for building and hosting is it fine sir ?



---

Hey [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) , I actually submitted the
project already in the morning,  
I included all the deliverables and things mentioned in the evaluation
section.

But since I was actively testing with the - `datagen.py` and `evaluate.py`, I
forgot to remove them before submission.

However these files do not play a role in my project execution in any way,
they just sit idle. Will there be any issue?

when i run POST request t is showing output “HTTP/1.1 200 OK” but when i give
GET request it is showing HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found. Can you please say how can
it be solved



---

These files are inside a separate folder - `evaluation` in my project root
directory. Since I already submitted please do consider.

Thanks & Regards  
Pradeep



---

This indicates your task execution returns “HTTP/1.1 200 OK” but the execution
doesn’t creates the required file in the given location that the evaluation
script is requesting.

**Image Description:**

The image features a yellow emoji face with a light blue halo hovering above its head. The emoji has a serene and gentle expression. Its eyes are closed with curved lines suggesting a soft smile, and a simple curved line forms a gentle smile.

The halo is a thin, circular band, positioned just above the head. The emoji's overall expression, combined with the halo, evokes a sense of innocence, virtue, or saintliness.

![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR and visual elements:

**Overall:**

The image is a screenshot of a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) window running on an LLM_1 (WSL: Ubuntu 24.04) environment.  It shows code being edited and the output from a terminal window.

**Editor Window (Top Part):**

*   The left panel (Explorer) shows a file directory listing: `__pycache__`, `.env`, `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `Dockerfile`, `llm.py`, `re.txt`.
*   The main editor window displays the contents of the `llm.py` file.  The Python code includes these key elements:
    *   `import os`, `import subprocess`
    *   `print(os.path.abspath("/data"))` (Prints the absolute path to the `/data` directory).
    *   Lines to download and execute a Python script:
        *   `script_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanandb/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py"`
        *   `email_arg = '21IF3002277@ds.study.iitm.ac.in'`
        *   `response = subprocess.run(['curl', '-O', script_url], check=True)` (Downloads the script using `curl`).
        *   `subprocess.run(['uv', 'run', 'datagen.py', email_arg], check=True)` (Executes the downloaded script named `datagen.py` using `uv` with an email argument).

**Terminal Window (Bottom Part):**

*   The terminal window shows output related to running `app.py` using `uv` (presumably Uvicorn, based on the message).
*   Key messages include:
    *   "Started server process"
    *   "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000"
    *   "CompletedProcess(args=['uv', 'run', 'llm.py'], returncode=0, stdout='DISCLAIMER: THIS SCRIPT WILL CHANGE BEFORE THE EVALUATION. TREAT THIS AS A GUIDE.\nFiles created at /data/n/data/n', stderr='...")" (Indicates that llm.py was run, and the output suggests the datagen.py script creates files in `/data`).
*   It shows network traffic, including a "POST" request to the URL of the `datagen.py` script.  The response is "HTTP/1.1" 200 OK, indicating a successful request.

**In summary:**

The code shows a process of downloading and executing a Python script (`datagen.py`) from a remote URL within a Uvicorn application environment.  The script likely generates data files in a specified directory.

![Here is a description of the image:

The image shows the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor with two files open: "app.py" and "Dockerfile." The "Dockerfile" is currently active and displays the instructions for building a Docker image.

The code in the "Dockerfile" sets up a Python environment, installs dependencies, copies files, and sets the command to run the "app.py" script. The Dockerfile starts with a base image, updates the system, installs curl, downloads the uv installer, adds the path and sets up a working directory.

Below the code editor, in the "TERMINAL" tab, the command "uv run app.py" is visible and seems to be in the process of execution. The output shows that the Uvicorn server is running and is listening on "http://0.0.0.0:8000". A request has also been made to a url.

i too got the same error you can change the the tools part in your payload to

    
    
    "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": schema} for schema in function_schema]

i think you have to run the following command

    
    
    uv run datagen.py <your_email> --root ./data
    

try to include --root ./data in your code

sorry i forgot the change the name of function_schema to tools please you do
that

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Hello,  
just a silly question, if my code runs well in docker environment with `/data`
in root directory, will it be fine ?  
or should i keep the relative `./data` directory like in the lecture ?  
Thanks



---

The reason in the lecture they were using ./data was because they were
debugging in their local machine not in the docker.

For the docker image (the official submission) you must use /data.  
It is a clear requirement mentioned in the project page.

Thats why it works fine when you use it in the docker image.

Kind regards

![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR and visual content:

**Overall:**

The image is a photo of a computer screen showing what appears to be a code editor or IDE (likely VS Code based on the interface).  It displays code, file explorer, and a terminal output indicating a failed test or program execution.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Code Editor:**
    *   Tabs at the top indicate open files: "taskA2.py", "evaluate.py", and "datagen.py".
    *   The main code window is displaying "credit\_card.png" (implying an image may be loaded/processed here) with a large number, likely the credit card number, in plain text: "390 6622 2036 7260".
*   **File Explorer (Left Side):**
    *   A directory structure is visible, including filenames.
    *   Files like "comments.txt", "contacts-sorted.json", "credit-card.png", "credit-card.txt", "email-sender.txt", "taskA1.py" through "taskA10.py", etc. can be seen.
*   **Terminal Output (Bottom):**
    *   The terminal tab is selected.
    *   Error messages indicate a failed test related to the file "/data/credit-card.txt".
    *   The "EXPECTED" and "RESULT" values show a mismatch in a number, presumably the credit card number. Expected is "4390652220367260078" while the actual result is "4390652220367260". It looks like the "078" portion of the expected value is missing in the result.
    *   There's an error related to an HTTP POST request to "https://alproxy.sanand.workers.dev", with a "failed: 'data'" error, likely indicating a problem sending data in the POST request.

**Interpretation:**

The user is likely working on a task that involves processing credit card information. The code is failing a test because it's not correctly handling or extracting the expected credit card number from "credit-card.txt". The HTTP request failure may be related to sending the extracted data to a server or API.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The word "ALID" is on the screen near the top middle, this may be a misspelling of the word "Valid".
*   The letters "HRU" are on the screen under the word "ALID".

In summary, the image captures a debugging session, with a focus on data validation and a potential problem with how a credit card number is being extracted and processed within a Python environment.

I’m also getting the same error. I have used a proxy URL and token. Before, it
was working, but now it’s not.

sir or anyone can you please provide what should be the content inside the
docker file … i am getting confuse like /data or python-slim etc  
… i am done with locally testing and only this thing left.



---

yes please explain somebody. What should be inside the dockerfile

Hi ,

Anyone completed Task B, I don’t know how to combine task A (function calling)
and task B (self creating python code)

can anyone suggest how to do that? It will be really helpful

“<http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1>” use this as proxy URL. its
working for me now!

sir,  
It is a humble requests from my side, to plz extend the deadline.  
Because student like who come from non technical background, are unable to
come up with this project…  
though we have somehow comeup with the GAs taking the helps of groups, seniors
and sessions.  
Moreover I am Dual Degree student. It is very hectic for me.  
Sir you won’t believe but I am continuously trying since last week. Specially
after the release of the sessions… Whole day and night have gone like nothing,
infront of the computer…  
Plz sir understand the situation and extend the deadline…

same issue happening with me even though working for last whole week only got
4 correct . please extend some time so we can complete the project as weekends
are the time when we get a day off from our primary college and can work with
full attention on this project.



---

it usually happens in some GNU/Linux OS. since you are using some distribution
based on Debian namely Ubuntu or whatever try doing sudo apt install python-
packagename (replace package name with fastapi for fastapi)  
then it works. It usually happens due to manual intervention with pip3 the
user might break some system dependencies which require some python3 package.
No need to worry about it.  
Another Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since
there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages.  
create a venv using python3 -m venv name_of_venv  
add this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source
/path/to/your/venv/location  
and run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your
virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3
install package name.  
It even happened for me

![Here's a description of the image, based on the OCR'd text:

The image is a screenshot of a terminal session on an Arch Linux system, specifically for a user named "jaideep".

*   **First Attempt to Install `numpy`:** The user initially tries to install the `numpy` package using `pip3 install numpy`.  However, they encounter an error message: `error: externally-managed-environment`. The terminal then displays instructions suggesting that the Python environment is managed by the system (possibly via `pacman`). It advises the user to either use `pacman` to install the package if they want a system-wide installation or to create a virtual environment (using `python -m venv`) and then use that virtual environment to install the package. It also references using `pipx`. A warning note indicates that this is by design and overriding it could break the Python installation. It refers to PEP 668 for details.
*   **Activating a Virtual Environment:** The user then activates a virtual environment by running `source /home/jaideep/.python3/bin/activate`.
*   **Second Attempt to Install `numpy`:** After activating the virtual environment, the user attempts to install `numpy` again. This time, `pip` indicates that `numpy` is already satisfied (meaning it's already installed) in the virtual environment's site-packages directory.
*   **Final State:** The terminal displays the prompt again, indicating the user is back in the terminal.

In short, the image illustrates a common issue where trying to use `pip` to install packages in a system-managed Python environment results in an error. The user then successfully utilizes a virtual environment to install `numpy` which was already satisfied.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/1/5/15e33e0ab5319a089a3cf734a66b3318dc7d08ac_2_690x181.png)

Most of your questions and doubts will be solved in todays sessions. First 20
mins will be a clear overview of the logic and workflow and how evaluation
actually works.  
Rest of the session will be bug fixing and doubts.

can someone send the meet link for the live session happening now

Everytime I run datagen.py for the A1 task, the data file gets downloaded in
the C drive instead of the current project folder. I even tried to set the
current project folder as the root directory but it still downloads the files
in C drive and I cant seem to find a workaround this. Can someone please help
with this issue. Thanks!



---

Can you please make the changes in the datagen.py file

config = {“root”: “/data”}

This is where I have been facing the issue.

The only solution I can think of is moving the /data folder from the root to
the project directory. which I am not sure is a good way to solve this issue.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir do i have to put env file
in docker

you have to give the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` to the evaluate.py by either  
bash - `export AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"`  
or  
powershell - `$env:AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"`  
the evaluate.py file takes the token to send request to embedding end point
for processing.  
so you have to set `AIPROXY_TOKEN` in both terminals  
i.e. app.py and evaluate.py teminals

![The image shows a terminal window, likely in a Unix-based operating system, where a user named Nelson is running commands related to a project called TDS-Project-1-LLM.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Terminal Setup:** The prompt `Nelson TDS-Project-1-LLM` indicates the user and project directory.
2. **Environment Variable:** The command `export AIPROXY_TOKEN=...` sets an environment variable named `AIPROXY_TOKEN` to a long string, which appears to be a token or API key, likely used for authentication with an AI proxy service.
3. **cURL Request:** The core command is a `curl` request. This command sends an HTTP POST request to `http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`. The `-H` option specifies the `Content-Type` as `application/json`. The request data is defined within the single quotes.  The request asks the service to generate text embeddings using the "text-embedding-3-small" model for the input strings "king" and "queen".
4. **Output:** The output shows the progress of the `curl` command (percentage completed, speed, time elapsed). Then the beginning of a JSON response is shown from the API. The response seems to contain a list of embeddings (numerical representations) for the input texts.  The output shows the first embedding starting with `0.03722809,`

![The image is a screenshot of a PowerShell 7 window displaying a curl command and its output. The command attempts to make a POST request to an API endpoint related to OpenAI embeddings, but it appears to be missing the correct authorization token.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **PowerShell Environment:** The prompt "PS C:\\Users\\Nelson>" indicates that the user is working in a PowerShell environment on a Windows system.

*   **Curl Command:** A `curl` command is used to send an HTTP request.
    *   `-X POST`: Specifies that it's a POST request.
    *   `http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`: The URL of the API endpoint.
    *   `-H "Content-Type: application/json"`: Sets the Content-Type header to indicate that the request body is in JSON format.
    *   `-H "Authorization: Bearer $AIPROXY_TOKEN"`: Attempts to set the Authorization header with a Bearer token, presumably stored in the environment variable `$AIPROXY_TOKEN`.
    *   `-d '{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["king", "queen"]}'`: Provides the JSON payload for the request, specifying the model and input text for embedding.

*   **Error Message:** The API response is an error message in JSON format:
    *   `"message": "Missing Authorization: Bearer header. See https://github.com/sanando/ai proxy"`: This indicates that the API requires a valid Authorization header with a Bearer token, which was not correctly provided in the request. The message also provides a link to a GitHub repository that might offer more information about the API.

*   **Likely Issue:** The issue is that the `$AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable is likely not set or does not contain the correct token. The variable is not expanded by Powershell because it is wrapped inside of double quotes instead of single quotes.

In summary, the user is trying to use an API to generate text embeddings but is encountering an authorization error, likely due to an unset or invalid token.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/d/bd8b1f78ee2e9e130956f545a8e96d89d6785b2e.png)

![Here's a description of the image:

*   **Object:** A yellow circle or sphere.
*   **Color:** The primary color is yellow, with some lighter shades suggesting highlights and a sense of roundness.
*   **Texture:** The surface appears smooth and slightly glossy, indicated by the highlight near the top-left.
*   **Background:** The background is black, which makes the yellow circle stand out.

It looks like a simple graphic representation of a yellow ball or a sun icon.](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/yellow_circle.png?v=12)


![Here's a description of the image:

*   **Subject:** The image features a single red sphere.
*   **Color:** The sphere is a solid shade of red.
*   **Shape:** The sphere has a perfectly round shape.
*   **Lighting:** There is a subtle highlight on the upper-left side of the sphere, suggesting a light source.
*   **Background:** The background is black.](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/red_circle.png?v=12)


![Here's a description of the image:

The image features a large, red "X" symbol against a solid black background. The "X" is depicted in a cartoonish or slightly stylized manner, with rounded edges and a glossy or shiny appearance, suggesting it may be a graphic design or a digital rendering of a cross or "X" mark. The color is a vibrant red that stands out against the dark background.

Even the markdown file shows the correct email. What are the possible issues
that I could be facing with this one.



![Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a code editor (likely VS Code) with a Markdown file named "format.md" open. The file appears to contain some unformatted Markdown content.

Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

*   **File Tabs:**  Tabs across the top indicate open files: ".env", "app.py", "evaluate.py", and "format.md". "format.md" is the currently selected file.
*   **File Path:** Above the content, "data > format.md" shows the file path.
*   **Markdown Content:**
    *   Line 1: A level 1 heading "#Unformatted Markdown".
    *   Line 3: A paragraph "This is a sample paragraph with extra spaces and trailing whitespace.".
    *   Lines 4-7: An unordered list with different list item markers (-, +, *).
    *   Lines 9-11: A Python code block embedded in the markdown using triple backticks. The code `print("user@example.com")` is displayed.

Overall, the image depicts a Markdown file containing a mix of headings, paragraphs, lists, and an embedded code snippet, suggesting it's being used to demonstrate or test Markdown formatting.

Respected Sir,  
I sincerely request you to kindly consider granting a one-day extension for
Project 1. Many key clarifications were provided in today’s session, and we
need just one additional day to effectively implement them. This extension
would be immensely helpful in ensuring a more refined submission.  
I truly appreciate your time and consideration.  
Thank you.

hey I have a few doubts, if something was said about this please say so.

  1. in Phase be tasks do we have to store the output in files or just return it in the response
  2. When I call my some of my endpoints using post man or CURL they work but if I run the evaluate.py it throws an error, this I think is a bug in the eval.py file.

any idea about these ?

can someone help me fix this error [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)



![The image shows a traceback from a Python program, indicating an error in the OpenAI library. 

Here's a breakdown:

*   **File "/app/app.py", line 35:**  This indicates the error occurred in a file named "app.py" within the "/app" directory, specifically on line 35.  The "in <module>" suggests this error happened at the top level of the script (not within a function).
*   **client = OpenAI():** This line shows where the error originated. It looks like the user is trying to initialize an OpenAI client.
*   **File "/usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/openai/\_client.py", line 110:** This indicates that there is an issue from inside the openai library itself, with the file '\_client.py'.
*   **openai.OpenAIError: The api\_key client option must be set either by passing api\_key to the client or by setting the OPENAI\_API\_KEY environment variable:** This is the most important part of the error message. It explains that the OpenAI client requires an API key to be set. This can be done in one of two ways:
    1.  By passing the API key directly to the `OpenAI()` constructor when creating the client. For example: `client = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")`
    2.  By setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

In summary, the error indicates that the program is trying to use the OpenAI library without providing an API key, either as an argument to the `OpenAI()` constructor or as an environment variable. The message suggests that the user should check if they've provided their API key.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/6/d64ee81798b48ccad186d5051823d3f565424bc2.png)

for the datagen script is it ok to hardcode the scripts url and my email id? I

Blunder in your `main.py`.  
You are using API_KEY = os.getenv(“AI_PROXY_TOKEN”) but it should be
AIPROXY_TOKEN.

Btw what you using for phase B?



---

yes i will change that

nothing i think, i’ll import those generic functions and use tool usage only
probably if can’t crack dynamic code generation

What we expect in project.

  1. server running inside docker container at 8000.
  2. And all files will be accessed from data folder in root directory.

Apart from these two you can have anything extra.

how to fix this error ?



![The image shows the output of a Docker build command failing. The error message indicates that the Docker daemon is unable to resolve the source metadata for the `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` image from Docker Hub. Specifically, it failed to copy data from Cloudflare's storage, likely due to a DNS lookup failure ("no such host") when trying to reach `docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`.

The Dockerfile itself is very simple, starting with `FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm` and then including a comment `# Install essential system dependencies`.

The error suggests a potential network connectivity problem on the host machine where the Docker build is running. It also mentions that the connection is direct and that it can't connect through HTTPS.

**Subject:** Request for Project Deadline Extension

Dear Sir,

This project is highly complex, and we need additional time to ensure its
successful completion. We kindly request an extension of the deadline to allow
for thorough testing and proper implementation. An extension would greatly
help us deliver the best results.

Thank you for your understanding [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

This might be problem with network settings(unstable internet, firewall, VPN
interference)

try to debug it with help of chatgpt.

You can also use codespaces for trying another network.

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) is it fine if i have my AIPROXY_TOKEN in my code instead
of getting it as environment variable?

if you do that then during evaluation, it would use your credit limit. if it

this is what i am doing first using the podman given in the portal and then
running the evaluate.py file



![The image displays a file directory structure, likely from a code editor or IDE such as Visual Studio Code, given the dark theme and icons.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Top-level Directory:** The root directories are `TDS-Project-1` and `tds-project-1`.
*   **Hidden/Cache Directories:** Both root directories have a `_pycache_` folder. This is a directory Python uses to store compiled bytecode for faster execution.
*   **.venv:**  A virtual environment for Python projects, which isolates dependencies.
*   **app Directory:** Within the `tds-project-1` there's a nested folder named `app`, which also has a `_pycache_` folder.
*   **data Directory:** Located in the `app` folder, this contains data-related files.
*   **Python Files:** Several Python files are present, including `_init_.py`, `funtion_tasks.py`, `main.py`, `datagen.py`, and `evaluate.py`.
*   **Text Files:** There is a text file named `task_to_embed.txt`.
*   **.gitignore:**  A file used by Git to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
*   **Dockerfile:** A file that contains instructions to automate the creation of a Docker image.
*   **README.md and LICENSE:** Standard project files for information and licensing.
*   **Version Control Indicators:** Some files have "2, U" and "3, U" next to them, which likely indicates version control status (e.g., in Git), where "U" might represent "Updated" and the numbers represent commits.

In summary, it's a Python project directory containing code, data handling, and documentation, with likely a virtual environment set up and a Dockerfile for containerization. Version control (Git) is also being used.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/e/ce7f8f838b86960153991fdea76f15b4a50f80f7.png)

ahhh okay, but i am getting an error while trying to fetch the token as an
environment variable. any suggestions to fix this issue?



---

you can use python-dotenv. check that out.



---

tried that still not getting T_T anyways thanks mate!



---

No don’t do that, just follow the procedure.  
Two problems with keeping token in file.

  1. It will become public after you push to github.
  2. While running evaluation script after submission your token might run out of credits.



---

ohh yes, didn’t think it through xD



---

I am facing the same error. and I have checked for solutions and found none.
Did you resolve it? If yes can you please guide me through it?

**Image Description:**

The image shows a bright yellow emoji face against a black background. The emoji has the following features:

*   **Eyes:** Large, innocent-looking eyes with prominent white highlights, giving them a pleading or hopeful appearance. There are tears welling up and about to fall.
*   **Mouth:** A small, closed-mouth smile, suggesting a hopeful or slightly happy disposition despite the tears.
*   **Eyebrows:** Slightly furrowed eyebrows, adding to the overall expression of sadness or vulnerability.

**Overall Impression:**

The emoji conveys a mixed emotion. It seems to represent a state of trying to stay positive or happy even while experiencing sadness or dealing with a difficult situation. It could be interpreted as a "cute" or "sweet" form of crying or a depiction of finding joy amidst sadness.](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/face_holding_back_tears.png?v=12)

**Image Description:**

The image shows an emoji. It's a yellow face with a slight smile. The defining features are its large, shimmering, and slightly glossy eyes filled with emotion. There are tears welling up and overflowing from both eyes. The overall expression seems to convey a mix of happiness and sadness, perhaps indicating gratitude, being touched, or feeling overwhelmed with positive emotions.

The image shows a yellow emoji with a complex expression. It has large, teary eyes with visible droplets falling from them. The mouth is formed into a small, gentle smile. The eyebrows are arched upward and inward, contributing to the overall look of being touched, grateful, or overwhelmed with emotion, potentially bittersweet. It's an emoji that conveys a sense of happiness or relief mixed with sadness or gratitude.

![Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a JSON response displayed in a dark-themed interface. The response indicates an error related to authentication. Specifically, the "detail" field contains the message "Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}". This means the provided authentication token is not recognized as being issued by a trusted source. There is a "Copy" button present in the interface next to the JSON data.

*   **Clothing:** He is wearing a light beige or tan colored kurta, which is a traditional South Asian garment. It has a collar and several buttons down the front.
*   **Background:** Behind the man is a wall overgrown with greenery. To the right, you can see a piece of art, possibly a mural or some other kind of decoration, partially obscured by the plants. To the left, a building facade is visible.
*   **Setting:** It looks like the photograph was taken outside, possibly in a garden, courtyard, or outdoor space with a building nearby.
*   **Accessories:** He has some type of bracelets on one of his wrists.

Hi ,

I am trying to build using both docker and podman but it failed on both. I
have watched many videos trying to resolve this adn also chatgpt in order to
resolve the issue but it seems to persist. I even uninstalled and reinstalled
both podman and doceker multiple times but no help.

When i run command docker build -t ___________ .

the error that comes is :

Even tried getting python:3.12-slim separatly and trying again but that also
didn’t work.  
I think there is some problem in getting python:3.12-slim as the build always
stops at this.

on asking ChatGPT it shows that some DNS or network issue is there. I even
tried all the remedy that was provided on creating custom network etc. but
this was also of no use

Kindly help me finding solution to this and pls mention any other assistance I
may require to get this running

Thank You.

Aagman

i am getting this error, I have tried many times but still the error persists:

someone please help!!!

[@carlton](/u/carlton) needed a confirmation on this task

`A8 * `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to
an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to
`/data/credit-card.txt` \- in this task i assume prompt can ask for credit
card number or other details like cvv and name.

My question is, whether my system should allow prompt that CVV or or such info
? or should give it ?



---

  1. Previously I asked for some more credits to test my project. I got an email stating I have been provided with a new token but I think I got that same token again, not a new one. I still cant send request to the AIPROXY. Please help.

  2. Do I need to submit the docker image name with the tag or without the tag? I submitted it before without the tag. Now i see that I have tagged the image with as v1 but I cant submit the form due to pattern matching problems. Should i submit again after tagging it with :latest ?

When I run my docker image using

`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

Task A2 fails as the podman container is unable to find npx.

Running the same image using

`docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

works fine and Task A2 passes. I can’t understand why this is happening.

I also ran the image in both docker and podman in interactive mode as show in
the below snippet from terminal.  
When run using docker, `which node` gives `/usr/bin/node` as output but when
run using podman, nothing.

*   **Expression:** He is smiling warmly, giving off a friendly and approachable vibe.
*   **Attire:** He is wearing a dark-colored top.

**Background:** The background seems to be a cityscape with tall buildings, but it's blurred enough that the details are not easily discernible.

*   **Return Format:** Instructions on how to format the returned list: including the name of the hike as found on AllTrails, starting and ending addresses, distance, drive time, hike duration, and what makes the hike unique. It also specifies to return the top 3 hikes.
*   **Warnings:** A caution to ensure the accuracy of the trail name, existence, and time information.
*   **Context Dump:** Provides background information about the hiker's experience and preferences (i.e. the hiker and girlfriend have done a lot of hikes in the SF area, seeking something different and unique with ocean views and good food; that the hiker is open to ending the hike with a celebration like the Mount Tam hike; also that they have hiked Discovery point to many times)

how…  
Plz some peers help…

It will be corrected soon by [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil)  
He is in charge of our budget for TDS and the tokens are being issued by him.

Please tag him for any token related issues.

New token assigned to the students. Emails are also sent.

sir I am noticing a pattern, that when I am running the datagen first. And
then using the evaluate.py, then I am getting the A2 right.  
But running the evaluation.py for the 2nd time cause the A2 to fail…  
Probabbly Because the file in the data folder gets upated should I worry for
that…



---

in the phase B, we have no idea about how many arguments are there, so should
we make every function mapping with 2 arguments ( 1 containing the input
location and other containing output location) or should we take the
parameters in some other way



---

There has been an outage in some parts of the country related to cloudflare
servers. What helped some students (and us) is using a completely different
network eg. instead of using your home wifi, use mobile internet, since they
go through a different DNS and this sometimes works.

Kind regards

We have not specified a size limit for the docker image, so in theory there is
not a limit to the docker image size.

![Here's a description of the image:

*   **Shape:** The image is a yellow triangle.
*   **Symbol:** Inside the triangle is a large, black exclamation point (!).
*   **Context:** It's a common symbol used to indicate a warning, hazard, or alert.
](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/warning.png?v=12)


![Certainly! Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a yellow triangular warning sign with a black exclamation point (!) inside. The sign has a glossy, slightly rounded appearance, giving it a modern, digital feel. The background is black.

![Here's a description of the image:

**Visual Elements:**

*   **Shape:** The image shows a large, prominent "X" shape.
*   **Color:** The "X" is colored bright red.
*   **Background:** The background is completely black, which makes the red "X" stand out.
*   **Style:** The "X" appears to have a glossy, slightly cartoonish or illustrative style, with rounded edges and highlights to give it a sense of depth.

**Interpretation:**

*   The "X" is a very common symbol that is often associated with:
    *   **Error or Incorrectness:** Indicating something is wrong or should not be done.
    *   **Cancellation or Deletion:** Removing something from consideration.
    *   **Rejection or Disapproval:** Signifying a negative response or choice.
    *   **Closing or Exiting:** In user interfaces, it is commonly used as a close or exit button.

**Overall Impression:** The image conveys a strong and clear message, using the universally recognized "X" symbol to signal negation, error, or a choice to close/exit.](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/x.png?v=12)

The image shows a screenshot of a Windows Explorer window. The title bar of the window displays "data". The address bar shows the path "This PC > Acer (C:) > data", indicating the user is currently viewing the "data" folder within the Acer (C:) drive.

The window's main content displays a list of files and folders within the "data" folder. The files and folders listed include:

![The image shows a snippet of Python code, likely part of a larger data science or machine learning project. The code focuses on setting up and managing a 'data' directory within the project's root folder.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

*   **Lines 35 & 39:** These are comments explaining the purpose of the subsequent code: to ensure all data files are accessed from the 'data' folder and to make sure this folder exists.
*   **Line 36:** This line defines `PROJECT_ROOT` as the absolute path to the current working directory. The `os.getcwd()` function retrieves the current working directory and `os.path.abspath()` makes it an absolute path.
*   **Line 37:** This line defines `DATA_DIR` as the full path to the 'data' folder. It uses `os.path.join()` to concatenate the `PROJECT_ROOT` with the string "data", ensuring the correct path is formed.
*   **Line 40:** This line creates the 'data' directory if it doesn't already exist. The `os.makedirs()` function creates the directory and the `exist_ok=True` argument prevents an error if the directory already exists.

In essence, this code snippet ensures a consistent and organized structure for handling data files within the project by creating a dedicated "data" folder and defining paths to easily access it.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/5/65498f6319cf654240d6dbf5f62a9313ebd5fd41.png)

I am also running datagen.py in the project directory, yet data folder is
created in C drive.



![The image shows a Python code snippet defining a function `run_datagen` that takes a `task_description` as input and extracts a URL and email from it. It then downloads a script from the extracted URL, installs the "uv" package if it's not already installed, and runs the downloaded script with the extracted email as an argument. Finally, it returns a success message including the URL and email.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1.  **Function Definition:** The code defines a function named `run_datagen` that accepts one argument: `task_description`.

2.  **URL and Email Extraction:** Inside the function, it uses regular expressions (`re.search`) to extract a URL and an email address from the `task_description`. The regular expression for the URL looks for a string starting with "https://" followed by any non-whitespace characters until a ".py" extension. The email regex checks for characters allowed in an email local-part, followed by @ sign, allowed characters in the domain name, and finally at least two characters for the TLD.

3.  **Error Handling:** It checks if both the URL and email were successfully extracted. If not, it returns an error message "URL or email not found in the prompt."

4.  **Script Download:** If both the URL and email are found, it retrieves the URL with requests.get and saves it to a local file named "datagen.py" in the `PROJECT_ROOT` directory. The function raises HTTPError if the request fails.

5.  **UV Installation:** The code checks if the `uv` package is installed. If not, it attempts to install it using `pip`. The `subprocess.run` function executes shell commands.

6.  **Script Execution:** Finally, it executes the downloaded script using `subprocess.run`. The script is executed using "python", and the extracted email address is passed as an argument.

7.  **Success Message:** The function returns a dictionary containing a success message indicating that the script was executed with the specified URL and email.

Sir earlier my code was running fine, but after the assigment of the new

wrong with the token…

I have do have cross verified the new token been correctly been assigned to
the system variable…



![The image shows two lines of text, likely from a server log, indicating web requests and their responses.

The first line details a POST request to the `/run` endpoint with a complex query string. The query describes a task involving an SQLite database file named "ticket-sales.db" located in the "/data" directory. The database is described as having a "tickets" table with columns like "type," "units," and "price." The task asks for the total sales of items with the "Gold" ticket type and instructs the server to write the number to the file "/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt." The response to this POST request is "400 Bad Request," indicating that the request was malformed or contained invalid data.

The second line shows a GET request to the `/read` endpoint, attempting to access the file "/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt." The server's response is "404 Not Found," indicating that the requested file does not exist. This suggests that the POST request failed to create the file or the server is configured differently.

when I run the evaluate.py by having datagen.py in same folder , it is running

downloaded into the /data folder right ?

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Kindly help me with this issue



---

Use following as first parameter of `subprocess.run()` to create `data/`
directory inside your project instead of C: drive

    
    
    ["uv", "run", script_url, user_email, "--root", "./data"]
    

Also, you don’t need to download to script, you can directly run it from the
url.



---

The reason for error is `evaluate.py` is trying to import `datagen.py` which
doesn’t exist in your system. I’ll suggest download both the files, keep them
in same folder and run `evaluate.py` from your computer



---

Yes actually Thats my doubt , when I run both in same folder it is working ,
but only after task a1 runs datagen.py will be downloaded in /data folder
right ?,

or did I misunderstood something??

sir for this task- A6 Find all Markdown (`.md` ) files in `/data/docs/` . For

"path/to/large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}` ) …I am
getting correct result for all files but for the very first file budget.md it
shows wrong.

do you able to do this task * **A5**. Write the first line of the 10 most
recent `.log` file in `/data/logs/` to `/data/logs-recent.txt`, most recent
first …  
i am also doing using prompt no hard-coded.



---

yes doing this only but finding correct for most of the files.



---

yes i am able to do task a5.



---

so you directly using prompt for doing this task.



---

yes i am only using prompt based method



---

If filename has number in its name then extract the number from the filename
and convert it to an integer before sorting .Ensure numbers inside filenames
are compared as integers, not as strings, to maintain proper order. Sort
filenames in said in task. Avoid any lexicographical sorting issues. i am
using this extra info for doing this but still it does not give accurate
result. can you help me in this



---

i already shared my repo u can check there.



---

you have pushed data,datagen and evaluate files…do we have to submit them as
well??  
(also send the docker file)



---

Check the file once, there is a possibility that it’s either fetching a
comment or the second heading. Refactor your prompt to search only for the
First Heading, specify it explixitly.



---

okay let me check once.  
one more thing sir {“first_name”: “Crystal”, “last_name”: “Wilson”, “email”:

This is happening because evaluate.py is unable to fetch your API Key from the

Key then try.



---

Hi everyone,

I’m running into an issue with the AI Proxy embeddings endpoint while
executing the A9 task. Every time I send a POST request to:

bash

Copy

    
    
    https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings
    

I receive a **401 Unauthorized** response. This, in turn, causes my code to
fail with a `KeyError: 'data'` because the expected JSON response doesn’t
include the `"data"` key.

### What I’ve Tried

  1. **Token Verification:**

  * I’m using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` obtained by logging in at [aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) with my IITM email.
  * The token is passed in the header as follows:

python

Copy

    
    
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}"
    

  * I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters).

  2. **API Request Details:**

  * The request includes the correct `Content-Type: application/json` header.
  * The payload is set as:

json

Copy

    
    
    {"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["Test"]}
    

  * Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized.

  3. **Debug Output:**  
Here’s a snippet of the debug output:

bash

Copy

    
    
    HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized"
    🔴 A9 failed: 'data'
    

This confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our
processing logic.

### What I Suspect

  * The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured.
  * There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I’m not aware of.
  * Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation.

### Request for Help

Has anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there
are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings
endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is
valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your assistance!

B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database  
Should I ask for the SQL data base. Or the agent should be smart enough to
find the required database…  
Moreover in the data folder there is only one database is it should be robust
to handle multiple databases…

I had a question on evaluation by the course team. To test that my application
would run everywhere, I first deleted all images from my local machine using
`podman rmi -a` and then ran `podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e
AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN $IMAGE_NAME` with the appropriate variables set.
This is as per the instructions provided
[here](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-
public/tree/tds-2025-01-project-1-wip/project-1). But this gave me the
following error:

    
    
    Error: short-name "freshbash/dataworks-agent" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in "/etc/containers/registries.conf
    

The above is the format in which we have to provide the image name in the
Google form. So, I was confused whether this would succeed during actual
evaluation.

The only way its working right now is when I specify the image name to be
`docker.io/freshbash/dataworks-agent`

I’m not yet very good with how containers work so some insights would be very
helpful. Thanks!

The image shows the "Codespaces" usage and billing information. It indicates that included quotas will reset in 10 days and provides a link to billing documentation.

It then breaks down the usage into:

*   **Usage hours:** Shows that 172.37 out of 180.00 included core hours have been used. A progress bar is almost filled with red color which implies very few included core hours are remaining. The cost for this usage is listed as $0.00.

*   **Storage:** Indicates that 9.21 out of 20.00 included GB-month have been used. A progress bar is filled with blue color for little more than half length. The cost for this usage is listed as $0.00.

Finally, it displays "$0.00 monthly spending limit" and provides a link to "Set up a spending limit", indicating that no spending limit is currently set. The cost for the spending limit is listed as $0.00.

The image shows the usage information for GitHub Codespaces. The information is displayed in a dark blue themed interface.

At the top, it says "Codespaces" with an icon of two brackets pointing towards and away from each other. Below that is a note saying "Included quotas reset in 13 days. See billing documentation."

The next section displays "Usage hours" along with a red bar indicating that the usage is at 100%. To the right of the bar, it shows "120.00 of 120.00 included core hours used" and "$0.00". This indicates that the user has used all of their allocated core hours.

The following section shows "Storage" with a blue bar indicating the amount of storage used. To the right of the bar, it says "1.46 of 15.00 included GB-month used" and "$0.00". This shows that the user has used 1.46 GB out of the 15 GB available for the month.

Both usage sections show a cost of $0.00, indicating that the usage is within the included quotas.

![Here's a description of the image based on what I can see:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a detailed and decorative depiction of an owl. The owl appears to be highly stylized, with intricate designs and patterns adorning its features. It has a mystical or fantastical feel due to the colors, design elements, and overall presentation.

**Specific Elements:**

*   **Owl:** The central focus is a frontal view of an owl. It has large, striking, bright blue eyes which are a focal point.
*   **Color Palette:** The colors consist of deep blues, purples, and golds, creating a rich and luxurious feel. The dark background further emphasizes the contrast and brilliance of the owl.
*   **Decoration:** The owl is heavily decorated with ornate patterns and textures. These details are found on its head, chest, and the area around its eyes. The designs are reminiscent of clockwork, feathers, or filigree.
*   **Background:** The background is dark, possibly a night sky or a deep, muted color, which helps to make the owl stand out more prominently.

In summary, the image portrays a decorative, stylized owl with a mystical and enchanting aesthetic.

I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile
already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of
dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was
showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by
iitm.

Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in
github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect
the Dockerfile?

Hey team, I just moved my Dockerfile to the root level on my Github repo. Hope
this solves the issue.

Small doubt: Do i need to submit the google form again?

I ran out of tokens. Please help me. Please its urgent.

what happened can you provide me more tokens.



---

Dear [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) , [@carlton](/u/carlton) , [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) ,
and [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

Thank you all for this wonderful project. Coming from a non-coding background,
I have learned a lot new things throughout this project building process.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir, yesterday’s session provided valuable insights
into Method 1 (prompt engineering) for dynamically handling tasks. I was able
to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time
constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks
and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate
everything thoroughly.  
Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.

I sincerely appreciate everyone’s guidance and support.



---

Did you ran out of tokens suddenly like me ?  
How many requests have you sent in total ?



---

can u share ur repo  
i really need it



---

Thanks [@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654) for this feedback. Glad to know
you learned from our efforts, it means a lot. This proves that even a person
from non-tech background with determination can achieve it.



---

sir pls provide more token [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)
[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir pls , give any reply we have
only 2 hr left

"image")

  
this problem occuring sir since two days



![The image is a screenshot of a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) IDE window.  It appears the user is developing a Python application named "algsoch," specifically a project labeled "vickykumarLLM."

Here are the key observations:

*   **File Explorer (left pane):**  Shows the directory structure of the project, which includes files like `database.py`, `main.py`, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, and several directories named `app`, `data` and `tests`.
*   **Code Editor (center pane):**  Displays the contents of `main.py`, a Python file. It shows code importing `FastAPI` and a task from `app.tasks`, defining a FastAPI application (`app`) with a route (`/`) that returns a message, and another route (`/run`).
*   **Terminal (bottom pane):** Contains a mix of outputs:
    *   Details the requirements satisfied with versions for Python packages like `fastapi`, `anyio`, `idna`, and `sniffio`.
    *   Notices about a new pip release and instructions to upgrade pip.
    *   Errors indicating a problem when trying to upgrade Python using `pip install --upgrade python`.  It states that no version of Python could be found that satisfies the requirement, hinting there may be confusion of package vs. core interpreter.
    *   A traceback showing a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'` when running `main.py`. This indicates that the `fastapi` package is not installed or not accessible in the current environment.
    *   Docker build output.
*   **Right pane:** A list of currently running terminals, that are used to run commands.

**Overall, the image indicates the user is having trouble:**

1.  **Running their Python application:**  The `ModuleNotFoundError` indicates that the `fastapi` package is not properly installed in the environment where the application is being run.
2.  **Building the docker image:** The building process is in progress.
3.  **PIP upgrades:** The image hints that the Python environment used to run these tasks may have some compatibility issues, and that the dependencies need to be sorted out.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/0/d084b074bcf4af69fe3e57753664fd39b016c2ef_2_690x365.png)


---

How long does it take to make a docker image, I’ve been doing it for the past
25 minutes and it’s still not completed.



---

  1. Your LLM app should be designed like it can give desire result based on task desc at run endpoint, and that result should be accessible at read endpoint.

  2. Evaluation file just for reference to check how things works and it works for phase A tasks only. Also ensure datagen.py file and evaluation.py file are latest. There is one issue in evaluation.py file for task A1, link of datagen.py file not correct, rectify that link. Even it corrected in GitHub repo file but when I download that raw file in local system it takes back previous link.



---

I WONDER HOW MANY API REQUESTS THE SERVER IS PROCESSING . It’s too slow



---

too much in the last few hours it feel



---

I guess what is done is done. I should have maintained my version history
properly. I am getting 4 correct but with minor formatting issues so only 1
correct I guess.



---

It was tough… I will probably not score much but I enjoyed it a lot. Thank you
for pushing us so hard. At least I am not scared of docker now and function
calling feels easier than before.



---

Well done, everyone! This is not an easy project. This is the kind of work our
clients are asking us for.

I will keep you posted on the evaluation on this thread, it progresses.

  * 2025-02-16T18:31:00Z Google Form closed
  * 2025-02-16T18:35:00Z Validating submissions. Will post results shortly



---

Sir i have missed the submission deadline by 5 minutes, can you give
permission for the google form to accept the response for half an hour more.



---

Sir, due to time panic, I mistakenly named the Docker image incorrectly.



---

Sir can you please allow submission for 5 more minutes?

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
Dear Sir,

I am writing to you in a state of distress and humility. An unfortunate
mistake on my part has led to the upload of an incorrect Docker image link.
When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though
the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly.

I have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours
and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully
passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying
off. However, this single error has left me devastated.

I am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake
by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my
application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an
exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an
application that is 890 lines long.

I beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means
the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback.

Thank you for considering my heartfelt request.

Sincerely,

Rishit Jain  
(24F2004595)



---

Although couldn’t complete handling every task, but really enjoyed working on
this project and learned a lot throughout the process. I appreciate the
opportunity to work on such an engaging project. For Project 2, I’ll make sure
to allocate sufficient time and approach it with even greater commitment.



---

Sorry [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)

### Sir, due to time panic, I mistakenly named the Docker image incorrectly.



---

Just push the latest image to docker asap. Hopefully the team considers it.



---

True. Same here. Just giving 2 days for this project was definitely a big
mistake on my part… but I couldn’t really give more time due to work
commitments.



---

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)

Sir, due to time panic, I mistakenly named the Docker image incorrectly.

I am not 100% sure but i guess i used “ii” instead of “i” in
“thevixhal/tdsvishal”… is there any way to check this ?



---

Can the submissions open just for some time? In minutes?  
Many students did silly mistakes due toh nervousness, we can just correct it.



---

I don’t think the project is too difficult to implement—it’s essentially a
simple HTTP API for an AI agent that reads a task, converts it into
parameters, and passes those parameters to specific functions to complete the
task. However, the instructions in the project question aren’t very clear.
Before the session, I am unable to fully understand the question. It took me
almost an entire day just to understand what we need to do.  
Sir Could you provide test cases or a sample answer for Phase B?



---

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sorry to disturb you, project1 deadline is over.  
I made a mistake in my project. In my call llm function i set some payload
instead of default for open ai api call like max token, temp. , n, stop etc.  
Due to this, some tasks may fail especially credit card image task will fail
100%, if possible can i just remove that payload from git hub repository . or
you can check this call llm function present in my task_handler.py file of my
repository.  
I found this issue after deadline. If possible consider this request. I never
engaged in a project or course like for this one. I love this project
genuinely.

Dear [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) ,  
Thank you so much for this wonderful project! We have learned so many things
from this experience, especially the power of prompts. The team has put in
tremendous effort, extending a few sessions and patiently clearing all our
doubts. We truly appreciate the dedication and support

Regards,  
Arjun

I would like to sincerely thank the course faculty [@carlton](/u/carlton)
[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) for their support on
the project throughout the week. They were so patient in listening to our
issues and helping us resolve them, even if the issues were repeated.

I was not able to complete some or maybe many of the tasks but overall, it was
a very good learning for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Thanks very much again for your guidance and support.

Regards,  
Swati

Thanks for your compliments Swati. It’s always nice to know our efforts paid
off.

I have received a mail that my project has ""No “MIT” in LICENSE;No Dockerfile
" which I saw today. My project has MIT licence and Dockerfile was also there…
but to reconfirm I pulled my dockerfile from dockerhub to github only . NOw am
not sure will that be considered now in my project submission or not.
Requesting to kindly consider current state of my project in submission for my
project.

@all those who didn’t submit, its ok EVEN I did NOT submit. Even though i get
zero, i am happy with the learning i did. Once again thank you sir
[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) . This a been awesome experience
, i haven’t been this alive in forever. Cheers.

I noticed something quite funny. The project never specified the required tech
stack, so one could have done this entirely with JavaScript as well, assuming
the necessary libraries are installed.



---

[@TheVishal](/u/thevishal)  
EDIT: Create a new docker image with the mistaken image name , so when they
pull image from repo, that image with the wrong name also gets pulled.  
what to do

  * push a new image with the mistaken name, so in your repo there will be two images  
  
how will this help?

  * since you are unsure, which image link you posted, you can be sure that even you had a mistake in link, a new image will exist with the wrong name after you push another image

@all  
use this to update your image even after submission, as now they only validate
the images, they do not pull it so you can edit your project and add more
functionality if they release the code solutiion

CHEERS  
Andrew OUT.

I didn’t submit the google form, I have made the github repo and docker image
for TDS project 1. I, mistakenly, thought that I had submitted the google form
but actually it was saved as a draft and closed my laptop. As soon as I
realized my mistake, I hit the submit button but this was shown then,  
“The form TDS Jan 2025 - Project 1 Submission is no longer accepting
responses.”

I apologize for this. I have been working on this project for weeks.  
This was my first TDS project. I would highly appreciated, if you could help
me.  
Thankyou

![Certainly! Here's a description of the image:

**Description:**

The image shows an emoji, specifically the "Grinning Face with Sweat" emoji. 

*   It's a round, yellow face with wide, slightly curved eyes resembling closed or squinting eyes.
*   The mouth is open in a large, joyful grin, revealing a hint of the tongue.
*   A single, stylized blue droplet of sweat is positioned above and to the side of one eye, indicating that the person is laughing so hard they are sweating.

The emoji conveys a feeling of amusement, happiness, and perhaps slight relief or exertion.

![Here's a description of the image:

**Image:** It is an emoji of a smiling face with a single drop of sweat. 

**Key features:**

*   **Face:** The emoji has a yellow face.
*   **Expression:** It's smiling widely, but it also has a single blue sweat droplet on its forehead. This suggests a feeling of nervous laughter, slight embarrassment, or relief after a challenging situation.
*   **Mouth:** The mouth is open with the tongue visible.
*   **Eyes:** The eyes are closed with a smiling curve.

Thank you, sir, for giving us this amazing opportunity! Honestly, I learned
more in the last week than I did throughout the three modules.

The project was a rollercoaster ride—especially with all the errors that kept
popping up—but overall, the experience was incredibly enriching. The amount of
knowledge I gained was truly valuable.

A huge thanks to [@Carlton](/u/carlton), [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini),
and [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir for their guidance and support. Without the last
week’s lectures, the project couldn’t have been completed.

i couldn’t my code space ran out of compute and then it was just lagging
before i found out what happened , i just submitted old code repo and the
image the we created in week 2 or week1 when had to create docker image for
graded assignments

This project is one of the best experiences I had in the entire degree
program. I could say this without any hesitation that what I learnt in the
past 10 days >> last 3 months.

I really appreciate the idea of open internet type of evaluations, wherein,
you implement things without any constraints, learning for the sake of
implementing.

Doing this project, I also found many new ideas wherein function calling can
be used to solve new problems. I also learned many new things from
enthusiastic peers like [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382) and also got the chance
to help a few.

I thank the entire TDS team - [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir,
[@carlton](/u/carlton) , [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) for their support throughout
this amazing experience.

Regards,  
Pradeep Mondal

![Here's a description of the image, breaking down the elements and probable situation:

**Overall Impression**

The image is a screenshot of a Postman request, a tool used for testing APIs.  The user is trying to send a POST request to a local server and receiving an error.

**Key Elements**

*   **Postman Interface:** This confirms the use of the Postman application.
*   **URL:** The request is going to `http://localhost:8000/run?task=The file /data/dates.txt con...`. It seems like the endpoint `/run` accepts a parameter `task` to provide the path to the file to run.
*   **Request Type:** The request is a `POST` request.
*   **Parameters:** In the "Params" tab, the `task` parameter is defined. The value associated with it is `"The file /data/dates.txt co..."`.
*   **Response:**
    *   **Status Code:** The response has a `200 OK` status, which is often misleading if the response body contains an error.
    *   **Response Body:** The response body is JSON. It includes an `error` object and some numeric values related to cost.
    *   **Error Details:** The `error` object indicates a problem with the `response_format.type`. The message is `"Invalid value: 'json'. Supported values are: 'json_object', 'json_schema', and 'text'."`. This suggests that the server is not expecting the JSON format, or that the request expects the raw text rather than JSON.
*   **Other Details:**
    *   The response time is `1.83 s`, and the size is `386 B`.

**Likely Problem**

The most likely issue is a mismatch between the expected request/response format and the actual format being used. Possible reasons:

1.  **Server-Side Expectation:** The server might be expecting a plain text response rather than JSON, despite the code indicating a JSON response. It might need to be adjusted to understand JSON.
2.  **Response Header Missing:** It is likely the server did not send a header saying "Content-Type: application/json" so that postman did not expect JSON as the response.

**In summary, the user is sending a POST request to a local server, intending to pass a file path as a parameter. While the server returns a 200 OK status, the response body indicates an error related to an invalid JSON format. The server expects the request to be handled as raw text rather than JSON.**

It clearly says in your error message:

Invalid value: ‘json’

if you look at the “type” key in your response_format variable at the top,

the value cannot be “json”

The error is telling you what the supported values are

‘json_object’, ‘json_schema’, and ‘text’

Since you are defining a schema the correct value should be ‘json_schema’

So therefore you should change

    
    
    "type": "json"
    

to

    
    
    "type": "json_schema"
    

If you have trouble constructing Json schemas,  
either feed it to gpt and have it correct it (along with your error) or please
go over Module 3, in particular

<https://tds.s-anand.net/#/llm-text-extraction>

There is a clear example you can use as a template. We use the same one as a
template when we do it in the sessions. That way you will make less errors.

Kind regards

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Would the scores of project 1 be released tomorrow?



---

[@Yogesh1](/u/yogesh1)

~~We do not have an ETA on Project 1 scores yet. Might have more clarity
soon.~~

Project 1 scores will be available roughly second week of March.

Kind regards



---

[@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654)

I know this is a late reply, but its not possible for us to consider changes
to your project after the deadline for academic integrity purposes.

If we were to allow it, we would have to allow everyone to make changes to
their project as well for it to be fair.

Kind regards



---

We will soon provide a complete solution for Project 1 because of its valuable
learning.



---

Alright, [@Carlton](/u/carlton). No problem at all, and thank you for your
response.

I just wanted to bring a small limitation in my project’s LLM function to your
attention, which I discovered after submission. It may impact one or two
tasks. However, no concerns—this has been a great learning experience.

And if possible, just add one line in your Evaluation LLM prompt: _“Give loose
marking for effort!”_ —because, you know, creativity deserves some extra
credit! ![:slightly_smiling_face:](https://emoji.discourse-

The image shows a classic smiley face emoji. 

*   **Color:** The face is a bright yellow color.
*   **Features:** It has two simple, round black eyes and a curved line for a smile.
*   **Shape:** The overall shape is a perfect circle.
*   **Background:** The background is black, which makes the yellow face stand out.](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=12)

I am not able to see my project marks please look into the problem



---

Its not been evaluated yet.

We are still processing them.

Kind regards



---

So will the solution be based on New MCP style or will they use the same
function calling?



---

Definitely MCP style. Its the most elegant solution and it works beautifully.
As soon as evals are done we will showcase it.



---

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Any ETA on project 1 scores?



---

I would like to request some bonus like 0.5 bonus mark for each day of delay
from the original expected date of receiving score for Project 1 (will be
life-saving for us and will be an incentive for team to release scores
quickly; or request to TAs if you had better ideas for helping us score more
in Project 1)! ![:smiley:](https://emoji.discourse-

PS ( [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) ): My P1 submission had
passed all the basic sanity checks on 15th February. No breaking modifications
to the Github repo nor the DockerHub image have been made since then. There’s
something bugged in your scripts. Kindly check.



![The image shows a list of checks or requirements for a project, and whether they have passed or failed. Here's a breakdown:

*   **"Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: FAIL"**: The project fails because it doesn't have a Docker image present in Docker Hub that is publicly accessible.

*   **"Is Github repo present AND public: PASS"**: The project has a public GitHub repository, so this check passes.

*   **"Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: PASS"**: The repository contains a Dockerfile in its root directory, which is a requirement, so this check passes.

*   **"Is MIT license present at root of github repo: PASS"**: The project contains an MIT license file in its root directory, so this check passes.

*   **"Prerequisites: FAIL"**: This indicates that the project fails to meet some other prerequisites.

*   **"Project 1 Score: 0"**: Because prerequisites failed, the score is 0.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/9/19ee62dc5d7a4dc1f92c30889a34483fe266978d.png)


![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR and the visual information provided:

The image shows a snippet from a table or list that likely represents a file or repository management interface. The table has three columns:

*   **Last Pushed:** Indicates the last time a file or repository was updated. There are two entries: "about 2 hours ago" and "2 months ago".
*   **Contains:** Indicates the type of the file or repository. There are two entries: "IMAGE" and "IMAGE".
*   **Visibility:** Indicates the visibility settings of the file or repository. There are two entries: "Public" and "Public".

The first entry indicates that a file or repository containing an image was last updated about 2 hours ago and is publicly visible. The second entry indicates that a file or repository containing an image was last updated 2 months ago and is also publicly visible.

The image also contains red markings (underlined and circled), highlighting "about 2 hours ago" and "Public".](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/e/c/ec83ed7abc829b1bf89cfa30f9c84c1075717a63.png)


![Certainly! Here's a description of the image you sent:

The image is a yellow circular emoji with an expression that suggests boredom, annoyance, or skepticism. It features:

*   **Color:** The emoji is a typical emoji-yellow color.
*   **Eyebrows:** The eyebrows are slightly furrowed and angled downwards and to the sides, which adds to the emotion of annoyance or skepticism.
*   **Eyes:** The eyes are looking slightly to one side (usually the left), and have a somewhat disinterested or unconvinced expression.
*   **Mouth:** The mouth is a slight, downturned frown.

Overall, the emoji conveys a sense of disinterest, mild disapproval, or skepticism. It's the kind of expression you might use when you're not impressed or have heard something you find dubious.](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/unamused_face.png?v=14)

    *   The repository name "TDS\_Project\_1" at the top.
    *   The main branch selected.
    *   A file listing with directories (like `_pycache__`, `data`) and files (`Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, Python scripts like `app.py`, `datagen.py`, etc.).
    *   Commit messages and timestamps for each file/directory.
    *   A sidebar on the right providing repository details (About, Readme, License, Activity, Releases, Packages, Languages (Python and Dockerfile).

*   **Browser Interface:** The screenshot shows the browser's address bar at the top, displaying the URL of the GitHub repository. There are browser tabs with names like "mit", "tds", etc.

*   **Snipping Tool:** There is a small window of the "Snipping Tool" application in the lower right corner. The Snipping Tool has the message "Screenshot copied to clipboard. Automatically saved to screenshots folder."

![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR output:

The image shows a terminal session, likely in a MINGW64 environment. 

Here's a breakdown of the commands and their outputs:

1.  **`cd hello_world`**: The user changes the directory to "hello_world".
2.  **`$^[[200~ls -l Dockerfile`**: There appears to be a garbled attempt to use the `ls` command with the `-l` flag to list the "Dockerfile".  The characters `$^[[200~` are likely unintentional input. The shell interprets this as an invalid command.
3.  **`bash: $'\E[200~ls': command not found`**: The terminal reports that the garbled command was not found.
4.  **`ls -l Dockerfile`**:  The user correctly executes the command `ls -l Dockerfile`.
5.  The output of `ls -l Dockerfile` displays the file's permissions, link count, owner, size, modification date, and filename.
6.  **`AC`**: The user likely types 'AC' in the command prompt.

In summary, the user navigates to a directory, attempts to list a file (Dockerfile) with an incorrect command, then successfully lists the file, and finally enters an AC command into the console.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/3/9/39b684382d117b9388443c38b9f83bad7be3e0ab.png)

1.  **`cd hello_world`**:  The user navigates into the `hello_world` directory.
2.  **Gibberish**: What appears to be `$^[[200~1s -1 Dockerfile`, it appears that some unknown data was passed to the terminal.  This resulted in the next line:

*   **Navigation Bar:**  The path to the directory is displayed: "This PC > OS (C:) > Users > hsent > hello_world".  There's a search bar on the right side labeled "Search hello_world".
*   **Left Pane:**  Shows common locations like Downloads, Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos, and folders (main, invoice new 1, Agent_ai, grok) as well as drives and network locations (This PC, Network, Linux).  "This PC" is selected.
*   **Toolbar:** Includes options like "New," "Sort," "View," and a more options button ("...").
*   **File Listing:** Files are listed with columns for Name, Date Modified, Type, and Size.

**Operating System Details:**

*   **Taskbar:** Shows common icons. The date and time displayed are "01-04-2025" and "11:32". The language is set to English (India).

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a developer's workspace, possibly for a simple Python project ("hello_world"). The presence of a `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, and a `.git` folder suggests a version-controlled project intended for containerization.

![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR content:

**General Layout:**

The image is a screenshot of an email. The email is from "22t1 se2002" to "me" and was sent at 1:27 am.

**Email Content:**

The email is addressed to "Dear Learner". The email informs the recipient that their Project 1 submission requires passing certain prerequisites. The email references details found on the "TDS Project 1: Evaluation page". The prerequisites are listed, including:

*   Github repository exists and is publicly accessible
*   Github repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license
*   Github repository has a valid Dockerfile
*   Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via podman run -e AIPROXY\_TOKEN=$AIPROXY\_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE\_NAME
*   Docker image uses the same Dockerfile in the Github repository

The email then provides a summary of the recipient's Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:

*   Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS
*   Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL
*   Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL
*   Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL

The email concludes with "Prerequisites: FAIL" and "Project 1 Score: 0". This suggests the recipient failed to meet the minimum requirements and their project will not be evaluated.

![Here's a description of the image:

The image depicts a yellow circular emoji with a neutral expression. It has two round, dark brown or black eyes and a straight, horizontal line for a mouth. The overall impression is one of being unimpressed, indifferent, or perhaps a bit reserved.

![Here's a description of the image:

*   **Content:** The image shows a hand making the "OK" gesture. The thumb and index finger are touching to form a circle, while the remaining fingers are extended upward.
*   **Color:** The hand is a tan or light brown color, typical of a skin tone. The background is solid black.
*   **Style:** It looks like a digital image, possibly an emoji or a small graphic.](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/ok_hand/2.png?v=14)
