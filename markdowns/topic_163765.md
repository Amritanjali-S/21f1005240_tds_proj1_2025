Despite saving multiple times, my score keeps resetting to zero. Should I
refill the answers for all the questions before saving again? Could this issue
also be caused by accessing the assignment from multiple devices?

Hi Shalini,

We are aware of the issue and [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) is working on a solution.
The temporary fix is to just reenter all the answers before hitting the Save
button. Thanks for the reminder, please bear with the inconvenience while its
being fixed.

**The last submission is always saved. So please make sure that your last
submission contains all the answers for all the questions.**

Kind regards

Hello,  
I am also facing the same issue. In my last submission the score was 7.25.
Right now it is showing 0. The problem is i had few questions remaining to
solve and i dont know which ones now. All of them r showing empty in the
solution box. Also i didnt write my answers someplace else, so i would have to
solve all the questions again? And also if i just for example for testing
submit solution of 1 question now then my score would get reduced from 7.25 to
the marks of that 1 question i submitted right?

![Here's a description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a medium close-up shot of a man with a serious or contemplative expression.

**Details:**

*   **Subject:** A middle-aged man.
*   **Facial Features:** He has dark hair, fair skin, and is wearing glasses. His gaze is slightly upward and to the side, giving the impression that he's in thought or observing something. His expression appears serious or perhaps slightly skeptical.
*   **Background:** The background is a warm, muted brown or tan color, creating a simple and somewhat neutral backdrop that puts the focus entirely on the man.
*   **Lighting:** The lighting seems to be focused on the subject's face, highlighting his features and contributing to the intensity of the image.

In essence, the image captures a moment of thoughtfulness or contemplation in the subject's demeanor.](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/s.anand/48/15264_2.png)
