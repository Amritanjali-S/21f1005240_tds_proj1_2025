---

Would we be able to start work on the questions 1 hour before the exam start
time?



---

[@bhashwar_sengupta](/u/bhashwar_sengupta) No that will not be possible. It
will go live only at 1 pm.



---

Got it. Thank you. Also, are there any standard set of instructions that we
need to follow during the ROE, like in OPPEs?



---

Is it 45 minutes long?



---

No, it is 45 minutes ‘short’



---

[@carlton](/u/carlton) will exam take place on the IITM Exam Portal (like
other JAVA, Python OPPE) or will it take place on the TDS course portal like
we had for Weekly GA?



---

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir, I could only find one live session of ROE in
youtube. Can you please point out where are the other recordings?



---

All week 7 sessions are ROE mock solving questions. Only the 4th session was a
special session and was labelled as such, but it also has a mock solving
component. These are all available on the Youtube channel



---

Sir we have to join the google meet for ROE or it’s an open book exam?



---

Is there a google meet that we have to join for proctoring?



---

[@carlton](/u/carlton)

I hope the Remote Online Exam (ROE) is ready to be uploaded to the portal. Is
there any update regarding the additional time request? Can we expect any
consideration on this?

I submitted my request at the following link:  
[Request for additional time for
roe](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/mock-roe-1-2-3-4-tds-

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Is the exam link enabled yet? Not able to see TDS in
the table given at [Exam](http://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/exam.html)

waiting for the quickest 45 min… based on previous GA , i might solve 1 ~ 2
questions.

the questions will be available from 1 onwards?



---

[@carlton](/u/carlton) The link uploaded on
<https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/exam.html> for TDS ROE might be incorrect…



---

Gmeet link is for support and collaboration. You can raise technical issues in
gmeet so we can help you . No proctoring for ROE



---

can we use ai for coding help



---

maybe finding the correct exam link is also a part of the exam?

sir help i tried in incognito as well



---

The exam link is working now.



---

were you able to resolve it ?



---

Yup! Based on previous GAs, 45 minutes seems pretty short.



---

HOW WILL WE BE ABLE TO ACCESS ANSWERS, WHETHER THEY ARE CORRECT OR INCORRECT.
JUST LIKE IN GAs?? will we have a “check” button??



---

Its fine the link is correct. Just that the exam is not available at the
moment, we have changed the error message. Exam will start at 1pm. Its also
hackable to start before.



---

You will have a check button



---

We have updated the error message.



---

yes … us ai, phone a friend, also ping here…



---

ping here? does that mean we are allowed to discuss here?



---

No this thread is only for technical doubts faced by students.  
But, you can create another thread to discuss it. Thats much encouraged.  
[@24f2007378](/u/24f2007378)



---

thank you, got one extra answer because of this.



---

Thank you Teachers for a great preparation using mock it helped us a lot and
really very difficult but interesting exam.



---

Thanks all for ROE exam. Got 9/10 , mostly guessing many might have got full
as prev. mocks conducted in last week was used.  
But, I want to thank for mock sessions , appreciate all you TA’s efforts in
last week. Take care

Regards,  
Harsha



---

I tried many times for correlation question. using numoy, excel, writing
explicit function. for all the three, i got -0.7144 as the answer. but the
portal showed incorrret.

Challenging ROE. Definitely should’ve studied more

---

thanks a ton [@carlton](/u/carlton) and to all the TAs. Performed much better
in ROE than I expected!!



---

ROE was challenging, but definitely Mocks helped a lot. I think mocks were the
best preparation for ROE. Did good because of it.



---

Your answer is absolutely correct [@23f2000573](/u/23f2000573)  
But the problem is you had to submit the answer rounded off to 3 decimal
places. A decimal more or less would result in a wrong answer.



---

Hello Sir"s, [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

I was able to successfully attempt only 5 questions within the time limit. But
due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm.  
My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could
already check my answers were in the portal.

I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due
a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode

Hi [@Muthupalaniappan](/u/muthupalaniappan)  
We have got multiple issues like from other students, we are looking into it
and figuring out what all we can do.



---

Even I had this issue but it was given in question to round off so once
rounded off, i would taken as correct



---

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) as I already showed
you in the meet that while submitting it was already showing 10, and for
surety and safety i clicked on SAVE Button, on resaving now it’s showing 0 and
dint get submitted properly…

As you can see from your records, I have already finished and submitted
everything correctly. This carries a lot of weight and will significantly
impact my grade, therefore I kindly ask that you take this into account and
give me full marks. So i beg you sir for considering my request sir, also
attaching the screenshot as you instructed in the meet for your reference sir.

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) / [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

I tried submitting my exam at 3:14 AM EST, but my browser reloaded
unexpectedly. I ended up re-entering my answers and submitted at 3:15:46 AM. I
had completed eight questions (8 marks) well before the time, but got stuck on
the last two.

you have to filter students with marks 30 or more in maths not biology and
then answer to question is total biology mark you have found the total maths
mark

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) / [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

I am Gudivada Abiram(21f3002158). In my today’s ROE exam I forgot to click the
save button. My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and
by that time the timer went off. I can even send my answers if required.  
I should have submitted more frequently, but I was busy solving the other
questions for extra marks.  
Could you please consider my request?  
Thank you.

Sir, I’m facing the same issue. While the recent scores say I have a score of
10, my final score shows 0. Kindly look into this, and please consider the
highest marks from recent saves.  
Thank you.



---

The same happened to me before the exam. Fortunately, I saw it before, and
charged my laptop.



---

Charging wasnt an issue for me, my entire vsc just froze and the screen went
blank during the last 5 mins. That was exactly when i got the code for q6 and
was trying to get the output and it froze, reopened at 1:45 and the time was
up



---

Hi [@23f2000778](/u/23f2000778)

No need to worry about that, I have checked in backend your score is 10 of 10.

kind regards



---

Hi [@21f3002158](/u/21f3002158)

I looked for your result in backend, seems like you didn’t click to submit
button throughout the exam.

Since roe exam portal was similar to GA’s where you need to save answers using
save button, after saving only your answers get evaluated and you get answers.

There is no way other than pressing save button, we can’t do any help with
this.

Kind regards

Kind regards

Hi [@22f1000535](/u/22f1000535)

We will be giving 2 minutes allowance, answers before 1:47:00 will be
evaluated, so you submitted at 1:46 so you will get 8 out of 10.

Hi [@Muthupalaniappan](/u/muthupalaniappan)

We have decided to give 2 minutes of allowance for network problems to
everyone, so whoever submitted before 1:47:00 will be evaluated, your
submission was at 2025-03-02 13:47:43 with 2 marks

Kind regard

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir, I got disconnected at around
1:35 due to a network glitch and had to restart my uv server as well collab
which wasted around 5 min and my score was around 7 and further I ran multiple
scripts which I had already saved as code snippets as part of GA for question
4 on vs code and Collab and finally got the answer but I exceeded the time
limit since the submission I made was at 1:47:28 which was 9…so I request to
please consider that  
Overall the ROE was a great experience and I wholly enjoyed the process

Thank you for giving us this amazing opportunity

9 marks? How were you able to crack the ROE?



---

Hi [@24f2003130](/u/24f2003130)

Your last submission before 1:47:00 was at 2025-03-02 13:42:34 with 8 marks,
we will consider that.

Kind regards



---

The questions were really similar to the GAs and mocks…I practiced them
beforehand and had code snippets ready to use…so I guess that was helpful



---

Ok sir  
Also I have realised the value of 28 seconds since my last submission (9/10)
was at 1:47:28  
I respect the rules of the exam and will be more careful in the future exams
to avoid such technical glitches.

Thank you



---

Thank you so much [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) for taking time out and checking the
records and considering my submission.  
It means a lot!

When I clicked the save button, it took an unusually long time to respond and
eventually showed an error. There was no network issue, as other applications
were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped
loading, and my browser became unresponsive. I’m not sure what caused this
problem, but I will share a screenshot to help diagnose the issue.

Hi [@23f2004781](/u/23f2004781)

I looked for your submissions in backend and can’t find any submission.

There was a technical support meeting going between 1 Pm to 1:50 pm on ROE
day, you were expected to join that meeting. You didn’t join technical support
meet before deadline.

Even on discourse we were continuously looking for new posts during ROE, you
created discourse post at 2:3 PM which was after deadline so we can’t help
with it.

I have attempted all the questions in the ROE and solved few of the questions
but i forgot to save the submission. At that time, I did not realize that I
have not even saved once during the time. After realizing that i have not
saved it in the evening, I have used the console to disable the save and saved
my answers. Is it possible to validate it? I don’t have any submissions before
1:45pm. I realize that it is my mistake for not being careful about it but i
request sir to be lenient about it as the project 1 was also difficult and i
have my exams tomorrow.

Hi [@Jayeshbansal](/u/jayeshbansal)

Until not clicked on save button answers get’s checked at frontend side only.
There is no way we can validate it after deadline.

I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before
deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated.

Kind regards



---

i have not saved even once during the deadline but i have submitted/saved by
hacking it in the evening when i realised that i have not saved it, i am
asking you to consider that as i really don’t have any saves before deadline
which will result me 0 marks, my request is to accept post deadline save by
being lenient about it else i will get 0 marks. I will be satisfied even if
you consider my 2nd save rather than latest save. (1st save was a sample test
to check if possible, so it was 0 marks but the 2nd save is under 1-2 min
which may prove that i have done all that questions before)



---

Hi [@Jayeshbansal](/u/jayeshbansal)

After deadline we gave allowance for 2 minutes considering network issues
students might have faced, so till 1:47:00 all submissions will be considered
valid, after that we won’t take any submissions.

Following are your submissions all of them were after deadline

Hello sir, [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Do you mean you will not consider them for evaluation then?



---

Yes, it won’t be considered.



---

yes, as you can see my first save is at 7:25 which was a trial check if post
submission is working or not but you can see that the 2nd and 3rd are saved in
approx 1 minute but i got 8 corrects which proves that i have done it before
only. the latest save got 9 marks as i forgot to run the fastapi server for
1st mark which resulted me 3 more minutes. So, I request sir to consider any
one of the saves except the first save



---

Sorry [@Jayeshbansal](/u/jayeshbansal) All your submissions were around 7
hours after 1:47:00 Pm, that’s why we won’t consider them for evaluation.

Kind regards

Hi [@23f3002537](/u/23f3002537)  
The problem is that, here you are sending headers unnecessary and overwriting
the original headers. Moreover you were returning the text of the response
instead of the json. Here is the revised version.

    
    
    from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
    from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
    import httpx
    import uvicorn
    
    app = FastAPI()
    
    # Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
    app.add_middleware(
        CORSMiddleware,
        allow_origins=["*"],
        allow_credentials=True,
        allow_methods=["*"],
        allow_headers=["*"],
    )
    
    @app.get("/api")
    async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
        headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
        try:
            async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
                response = await client.get(url)
                return response.json()
        except httpx.RequestError as e:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Request failed: {str(e)}")
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)

Hello [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir,

Will it be possible to consider only the minutes. I also cannot control the
technical delays. I raised the point as fast as possible and I also joined the
technical GMEET and exited when a different person raised the same question.

I would dearly propose to consider still 1:47. But if it’s 1:48 you can
ofcourse not consider it. But the “seconds” is something unrealistic.

Please re consider this request sir.



---

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) Could you please verify if my score will be accepted by
you? I saved only once: at 1:47 pm. My roll number is 21f2001573.



---

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
When will the results of ROE will out.



---

Probably, by this week



---

I checked your submission, its at 1:47:30 PM. We are going to give a grace
period of 2 minutes past 1:45 PM. Given that you submitted 30 seconds past
1:47, we won’t be able to consider it.  
Regards



---

Please reconsider this decision. In the heat of the moment, I failed to save.
In my mind, I was sure that I had saved it. There is one other student with
the same problem ( saved a few seconds after 1:47).

Since I did only one save, I would get zero marks if the score is not
considered.

I didn’t submit any new answer after 1:45 pm.

Please reconsider if possible.

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

Am facing the same issue sir, will wait a few hours and update… I ensured I
submitted atleast 5 times till 1:45



---

I submitted 5 times minimum before 1:45 with a score of 7 [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)
[@carlton](/u/carlton) out of curiosity i also submitted thrice after exam at
like 2 or so just to know how to solve the other qs withscore of 9. I will get
the 7 considered right? I submitted them at like 1:43 or so. Please confirm.
It still shows absent

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

Do we get bonus marks for submitting the student feedback Google Form?



---

Sir , it is still showing absent for me for Roe result, I had submitted before
the deadline as well my score was 2/10 but the result is showing absent. Can u
please look into this and revert



---

Any updates sir ? [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) It was told, it
will be updated in a few hours and now it’s been a day. Am scared!



---

Dont worry, we have the right scores on our server. There has been some
problem in sending the export to the operations team. Your scores are safe. We
are working on figuring out the problem. Even the bonus marks are recorded.
Just give us a couple of days to sort it out. Many students have been affected
so we cant give individual responses right now. Its a system fix that needs to
be implemented.



---

Respected Sir,

I noticed that my status is still marked as absent. I understand I may be a
bit impatient, but I wanted to clarify my submission. I had submitted the ROE
on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed
until 1:47 PM.

Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about
the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my
initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I
was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that
students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks
when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last.

Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still
achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also
everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same
manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my
mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had
conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a
standalone degree for me, I’m actually worried about it. When I learned how to
unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time.

Please consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks
still got submitted  
rollnumber 23f2001390

The latest submission before the deadline would be 3 marks. That is what would
be considered.

Ok sir will the bonus 1 mark also be included for filling the gform, also I
had scored 10 later is that also there or only 4 max is present?



---

yes 1 bonus will be added if you filled the form according to the
