Dear all,

I’m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the *Tools in
Data Science * course: [**LLM Classroom Assignment
Evaluator**](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom).
This is the basic prototype.

This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for
Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for
educators.

A heartfelt thanks to **[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)** , our course instructor, and
TAs **[@Carlton](/u/carlton)** and **[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)** , whose guidance
on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project
possible.

I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:

  * Expand functionality and evaluation models.
  * Fix bugs and optimize workflows.
  * Improve documentation for broader accessibility.

The [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom)
is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating
with you all!

Update: here is a video explaining the process -

Hi Avinash,

Thats great work! I am glad you were able to use what you learnt from the
course for something so practical. I hope you continue to develop and refine
it, take feedback from the stakeholders who would be interested in this
approach. I see a lot of potential in this project.

Kind regards

Thanks [@carlton](/u/carlton) ![:blush:](https://emoji.discourse-
cdn.com/google/blush.png?v=12) I would definitely refine it.



![Certainly! Here's a description of the image you sent:

**The image is of a yellow smiley face emoji with rosy cheeks.**

*   **Color:** The face is a standard yellow color.
*   **Facial features:**
    *   It has two simple, curved, closed eyes.
    *   It has a simple, curved line for a smiling mouth.
    *   There are noticeable pink, round, rosy cheeks on either side of the face.
*   **Background:** The background is black.

It evokes a feeling of happiness, contentment, and perhaps a bit of shyness or blushing.
