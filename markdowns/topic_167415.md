I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile
already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of
dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was
showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by
iitm.

Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in
github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect
the Dockerfile?

The name of the Dockerfile should be “Dockerfile” indeed, more over check
other sections of your submission like

  * Is the GitHub repo public?
  * Does it have an MIT license?
  * Does it have a DockerFile?
  * Is the Docker image accessible?

Oh ok made the changes in Github. I hope submitting again is not required
since the links and names are same.

Sir, i got this mail. I have checked that the repo is public and already has a
Dockerfile.  
I have renamed the ‘LICENSE’ file as ‘MIT LICENSE’.



![The image contains text that indicates a submission checklist failure. The first line, "No such repo; No "MIT" in LICENSE;No Dockerfile," lists specific issues: a missing repository, the absence of an MIT license, and the lack of a Dockerfile. The second line, "Please ensure that your submission passes the above checklist for it to be even considered for scoring," emphasizes that addressing these checklist points is essential for the submission to be eligible for evaluation.

Sir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in
Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository. On my local repository it
was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you
autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change
even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it
was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo.

Sir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a
resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just
that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too
“Rename dockerfile to Dokerfile” . Sir please attest consider what we have
already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too.

Sir it is a humble request to please consider it.

Warm Regards,

![Here's a description of the image based on the provided information:

The image shows a file explorer or repository interface, likely from a code hosting platform like GitHub. It displays a list of files and folders within a project:

*   **Folders:**
    *   Business
    *   Operations
    *   app
*   **Files:**
    *   Dockerfile
    *   LICENSE
    *   README.md

The interface also displays information about the recent activity associated with each item:

*   "Reconfigured taskB8 taskB9 taskB10" - 2 days ago (for the Business folder)
*   "Reconfigured taskA8 taskA9 taskA10" - 2 days ago (for the Operations folder)
*   "Updated Dockerfile and requirements.txt" - 2 days ago (for the app folder)
*   "Rename dockerfile to Dockerfile" - yesterday (for the Dockerfile)
*   "MIT License" - 3 days ago (for the LICENSE file)
*   "Project Structure" - 3 days ago (for the README.md file)

The general appearance is a dark theme, common in code editors and developer tools. There are icons on the right side, indicating repository settings and activity.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/1/a/1a5f2ea044383efcb5d248ddb487665e9e65957d_2_690x170.png)
