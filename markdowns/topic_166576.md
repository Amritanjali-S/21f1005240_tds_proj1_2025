i can’t load my questions



![Here's a description of the image based on the provided information:

The image shows the interface of an online exam platform or learning management system. The user is logged in with a specific email address, "23f1002630@ds.study.litm.ac.in". There's a logout button at the top.

The "Recent saves" section indicates that there are no saved exams or attempts. The interface displays "Loading questions...", but an error message in a red box appears below. The error message states "Sorry, we couldn't load the questions. That's strange." followed by "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1')" and "Please contact the exam team for assistance.". This suggests there is an issue with the platform loading exam questions.

[@23f1002630](/u/23f1002630) \- thanks for raising this. It’s fixed and won’t
re-occur for anyone.

**What happened?** I picked random duration from the video of 10-40 seconds,
but forgot to ensure that the end time should not exceed the video length.
That’s what I fixed.

It was solved but again I’m facing the same issue



![Here's a description of the image you sent, based on the OCR and visual elements:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web application or online testing platform displaying an error message. The interface has a dark theme, and it's clearly having trouble loading content.

**Elements:**

*   **Top Section (Green Box):** Title: "Recent Saves (most recent is your official score)" with message "No recent saves"
*   **Middle Section (Teal/Blue Box):** Displays a "Loading questions..." message with a loading spinner animation.
*   **Error Section (Red Box):** An error message is displayed.
    *   Title: "Error!"
    *   Message: "Sorry, we couldn't load the questions. That's strange."
    *   Technical Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1')"
    *   Call to Action: "Please contact the exam team for assistance."
*   **Buttons (Bottom):** There are two buttons: "Check all" and "Save".

**Interpretation:**

The application is failing to load the questions, likely due to a technical issue related to accessing or processing data (the error message suggests a problem with a variable being undefined). The user is prompted to contact support. The appearance of "Check All" and "Save" suggests the exam questions or answers haven't loaded yet.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/0/d00d9bc84126cc644cd4a75cea1db8ab4d4bf0a6_2_690x277.png)

i guess there’s some issue in 5th question as i have correctly filtered the

OpenRefine question has historically been a tricky question to get right.
Check out some past TA sessions in previous term for solving it, or previous

![Here's a description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a portion of a spreadsheet, likely from a program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. The spreadsheet appears to be tracking sales data.

**Columns and Data:**

*   **Column A (city):** Contains city names. The city name is misspelled with several variations "Sau Paulo," "Sao Pualo," and "Sao Paoulo," and "Sao Paolo."
*   **Column B (product):** Indicates the product being sold, which is "Bacon" in all visible rows.
*   **Column C (sales):** Shows the sales figures (numbers) for each row.

**Formatting and Features:**

*   **Header Row:** The first row (row 1) appears to be the header row, with labels for each column. The header cells (A1:C1) are highlighted in orange.
*   **Filters:** The filter icons in the header row of each column, suggest that filtering is enabled on this data. This allows the user to sort and filter the data based on the values in each column.
*   **Misspellings:** The city name "Sao Paulo" is consistently misspelled, indicating a potential data entry error or inconsistency.
*   **Totals:** Cell C2502 contains the number 2871, likely a sum or total calculation of the sales figures in column C.

**Overall Impression:**

The spreadsheet is a basic sales report with location, product, and sales figures. The consistent misspelling of the city name suggests a need for data cleaning or validation. The use of filters indicates that the user is likely analyzing or manipulating the data.

**Overall:**

The image is a document outlining a task for a data analyst, focusing on analyzing website access logs to determine peak usage patterns. The context is regional content, specifically relating to the "telugu" section of a website.

**Key Information Extracted from the Text:**

*   **Website:** s-anand.net
*   **Content Focus:** Region-specific music, particularly "telugu" content.
*   **Goal:** Determine the number of successful GET requests for pages under "telugu" during peak hours (13:00 until before 23:00) on Saturdays between May 13th and 23rd in 2024.
*   **Request Type:** Only GET requests
*   **Success Criteria:** HTTP status codes between 200 and 299 are considered successful.
*   **Data Source:** GZipped Apache log file (61MB), containing 258,074 rows of logs from May 2024.
*   **Log File Format:** Non-standard; fields are space-separated and quoted with double quotes. Time field is not quoted. 41 rows have issues with how quotes are escaped.
*   **Timezone:** GMT-0500
*   **Log File Fields:** A description of the fields in each log entry is provided (IP address, remote logname, remote user, time, request, status, size, referer, user agent, vhost, server).
*   **Impact of Analysis:** The analysis will help optimize infrastructure, strategize content delivery, and improve marketing efforts.

Update: I tried for both (thank god for filters in Excel) and Sunday is what
the question is asking for. The Instruction above for “Saturday” is incorrect-
maybe the logic generating different questions for different students can be
tweaked-

Thank you

I’ve attempted this question several times and I’m fairly certain that the
answer to this question is incorrect. I’d be grateful if the answer to this
question was re-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here,
however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public
forum.

![Here's a description of the image content:

**Overall:**

The image shows a case study document outlining a data recovery task for ReceiptRevive Analytics. The case study focuses on recovering sales data from digitized receipts that have been incompletely processed by OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

**Key elements of the document:**

*   **Title:** "Case Study: Recovering Sales Data for ReceiptRevive Analytics"
*   **Introduction:** Explains that ReceiptRevive Analytics specializes in processing legacy sales data from paper receipts. The OCR process can lead to incomplete JSON data due to damaged receipts.
*   **Client:** RetailFlow Inc., who needs to recover total sales information for analysis. The data contains 100 rows, each representing a sales entry.
*   **Data Fields:** Lists the four key data fields expected in each sales entry:
    *   city: The city where the sale was made.
    *   product: The product that was sold.
    *   sales: The number of units sold (or sales revenue).
    *   id: A unique identifier for the receipt.
*   **Problem:** The JSON entries are truncated, and the "id" field is often missing. The focus is on aggregating the "sales" values.
*   **Your Task:** Details the tasks for a data recovery analyst at ReceiptRevive Analytics:
    1.  Parse the Sales Data: Extract sales figures.
    2.  Data Validation and Cleanup: Handle incomplete data, focusing on "sales" values.
    3.  Calculate Total Sales: Sum the "sales" values.
*   **Benefits:** Lists the benefits of successfully recovering and aggregating the data.
*   **Data Source:** Provides a link to download the data: "q-parse-partial-json.jsonl"

In summary, the document is a problem statement and task description for a data recovery project focused on sales data extraction and aggregation from incomplete OCR output.

[@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
Q5 fixed, thanks for fixing the issue.

Now we are struggling with Q8.  
MY q8 is : Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after
2025-01-09T12:36:14.085Z with at least 1 comment with 4 useful stars, sorted.
The result should be a table with a single column called `post_id` , and the
relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order.  
when i use below query, i get some some result, a table of post_id but error :
**Error** : At root: Array length mismatch  
**Reason** : below query checking only 1st comment (`$[0]` refers to the first
comment in the array) we have to check all comments not 1st.  
But when i change the query to check any one comment its giving different
types of error.

    
    
    WITH filtered_posts AS (
      SELECT post_id
      FROM social_media
      WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-09T09:48:01.303Z'
        AND EXISTS (
          SELECT 1
          FROM social_media AS sm
          WHERE json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') IS NOT NULL
            AND CAST(json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') AS INTEGER) > 4
        )
    )
    SELECT post_id
    FROM filtered_posts
    ORDER BY post_id ASC;
    

Kindly check if any issue with Q8.  
May be my query is wrong or may be not.

Thankyou

[@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654)

Your query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be
difficult to debug.

Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end.  
In this case its an ordered `post_id`

So thats where you begin:

    
    
    SELECT post_id
    FROM (
    ...
    )
    ORDER BY post_id
    

Doing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet.

Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity.  
You will still need the `post_id` for the _outermost layer_ so you have to
continue extracting it from the _inner layers_ of the nested query.

    
    
    ...
    ...
    FROM (
       SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars
       FROM social_media
       WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given)
          AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given)
    )
    ...
    ...
    

Then the final layer of the nest

    
    
    ...
    ...
    (
    
    ) as max_stars
    ...
    ...
    

You are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner
most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful
capability)

But I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory
language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades.

Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work
backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the
outer layer to be functional.

Kind regards



---

Its been done. You will get a more detailed error now. And we have relaxed the
number of errors allowed (it actually did have a tolerance limit but it was
fairly tight)



---

sir even after applying this logic im getting error at root: array length
mismatch



---

[@daksh76](/u/daksh76) thats because your innermost logic layer must not
return a long list of results.

If you think about it logically each row cannot have a column field where one
of the columns is a whole row of results right?

Thats why you are getting the error.

Check your innermost layer is returning a single value or a row of results.

Kind regards



---

Thank you for your response [@carlton](/u/carlton). You are absolutely
right—my query was unnecessarily complex. Initially, I attempted a simpler
approach, using various JSON extraction functions. However, I encountered
multiple errors, including:

  1. **`json_extract`** : _“Table Function with name ‘json_extract’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”_
  2. **`json_each`** : _“Table Function with name ‘json_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”_
  3. **`json_extract_path_text`** : _“Table Function with name ‘json_extract_path_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”_

Since the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to
achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected
output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the
console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am
still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog.  
I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue. I do not need the
exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for
**Q8**.

Thankyou

In this question, I am asked to find the total margin for transactions before
**Tue, Jun 14, 2022, 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)** for **Theta**
sold in **the US** (which may be spelled in different ways).

However, when I filter in Excel for **US** and **Theta** , there are no
entries for **Sales** and **Cost**. But **0** as the answer is not accepted—it
says the answer is incorrect.

(I cross-checked this using GPT.)



![The image is a document outlining a task to improve sales data accuracy for a company called RetailWise Inc. It starts by describing the problem: RetailWise has received a messy Excel sheet with 1,000 transaction records from scanned receipts, suffering from OCR inconsistencies and legacy formatting issues. The document lists various issues within the data, such as inconsistent country representations, mixed date formats, product names followed by random codes, extra spaces in sales and cost fields, and inconsistent spacing in transaction IDs.

The document then defines the task: cleaning the Excel data and calculating the total margin for specific transactions based on time, product, and country filters. The required filters are: sales up to and including June 14, 2022, 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time), transactions for the product "Theta", and transactions from the US. The total margin is defined as (Total Sales - Total Cost) / Total Sales.

Several challenges are listed to guide the solution: trimming and normalizing strings, standardizing date formats, extracting product names, cleaning and converting sales and cost values, filtering data, and calculating the margin.

The document highlights the benefits of cleaning the data, including improved decision-making, enhanced reporting, and streamlined operations. A link is provided to download the Excel file containing the sales data.

Finally, there is a question asking for the total margin for transactions meeting the specified criteria. An incorrect answer, "0.0," has been entered, and a message prompts the user to enter the margin as a percentage or a decimal.

to be sanitised before you start filtering.

For Q8, I wrote the following query,

    
    
    SELECT smo.post_id
    FROM social_media as smo
    WHERE smo.timestamp >= '2024-11-15T06:02:28.656Z'
    AND EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM LATERAL (
           SELECT UNNEST(json_extract(comments, '$[*]'))
           FROM social_media as sm
           WHERE sm.post_id = smo.post_id
           ) AS c(value)
        WHERE json_extract(c.value, '$.stars.useful')::DOUBLE = 4)
    order by smo.post_id;
    

What it does is for each post_id, checks the timestamp and then checks the
presence of a json object in comments that has 4 stars useful rating for this
post_id. Finally returns all the post_id’s in ascending order.

But it’s giving me an `Array length mismatch` error. I’m stuck here. Any hints
would be helpful. [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

P.S. I also noticed that the timestamp given in the question keeps changing
with each page reload. But the output from the query stays the same.

**QUESTION 9**

I was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain
time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences
from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the
error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual
audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know
what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the
exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5
seconds.

Here was my transcription - " Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda
followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of
determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of
friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage
beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy,
and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best
left undisturbed.

In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice
emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some
secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”

The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of
Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden
alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.

Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that
manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation
tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.

From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with
names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary,
strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal
hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored
evidence of their manipulations.

Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for
decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her
steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged
with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the
manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another
revelation "

students get different questions. [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

recent score shows the points, but overall score is 0. Please take a look.



![Here is a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a website page, likely an online quiz or assignment interface. 

**Header:** The top area indicates an end date and time: "Ended at Fri, 21 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST". There are also the words "Score: 0" and the buttons "Check All" and "Save".

**Title:** The main title appears to be "TDS 2025 Jan GA5 - Data".

**Instructions:** A section titled "Instructions" contains a list of numbered points offering guidance to the user. Here are some key points:
*   Encouragement to skip reading material if the user knows the answers.
*   The importance of regularly checking answers using a "Check" button.
*   The advice to save regularly using a "Save" button.
*   Confirmation that reloading is acceptable and saves are stored in the browser.
*   A warning that the browser may struggle and suggestion to turn off security restrictions if problems occur.
*   Permission to use any resource, including the Internet, ChatGPT, and friends.
*   A declaration that the quiz is "hackable" with the potential to find answers by hacking the code.

**Question Link:** The page features a button with a speech bubble icon and the text "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse".

**User Information:** It confirms the user is logged in as "23f1002709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" and has a "Logout" button.

**Recent Saves:** A section titled "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)" shows a log of saves with timestamps and a score. All saves display a score of 10 and timestamp from 2/21/2025 and times from 4:40:14 PM to 4:40:22 PM. Each save has a "Reload" option.

**Overall Impression:** The page presents a somewhat unorthodox quiz or assignment environment with unconventional instructions, suggesting a more open and potentially exploratory approach to problem-solving.

You can load answers using reload button on every assignment.  
You can enable check answers button.

No need to worry about that.

I didn’t attempt it to reload the answers. How do i enable check answers
button? [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)

EDIT: I just went to the html and removed disabled from each relevant check
box and also the form-control input part, It works now, Thank you
