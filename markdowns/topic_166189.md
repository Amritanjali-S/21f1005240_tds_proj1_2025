*   **Subject:** A young man with short, dark hair. He is smiling.
*   **Clothing:** He is wearing a striped shirt (possibly blue and white).
*   **Pose:** He appears to be sitting or standing with a relaxed posture.

I saved that too but right now scores of GA2 isn’t visible for me. And in

Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is
not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have
submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it
cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some
time.

Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside
your seek portal.

**The scores will only be visible in the dashboard.** Just ignore anything
inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards
exists.

As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The
final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not
match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us
regarding your marks.

Kind regards

![Here is a description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of a web page, likely an online assignment or quiz.  The page is titled "Graded Assignment 3: IITM" and appears to be part of a course or exam. The URL is "exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga3".

Here are the key elements on the page:

*   **Header:** Indicates the assignment deadline as "Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST". It also shows the current score as "Score: 0" and buttons for "Check all" and "Save".
*   **Instructions/Notes:**  There are instructions or notes related to the exam/assignment. Key points include:
    *   Browser may struggle
    *   Using any resource is allowed (Internet, ChatGPT, friends)
    *   The assignment is hackable
    *   Multiple servers may be running
*   **Questions Area:** There is text indicating "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse" which likely links to a forum or discussion board for the assignment.
*   **Login Information:** Displays the user's logged-in email address: "23f3004066@ds.study.iitm.ac.in".  A "Logout" button is also present.
*   **Recent Saves:** Shows a list of recent save timestamps and scores.  The saves all have a score of 8.
*   **Questions** There is text indicating "Questions" at the bottom of the image.

In general, the web page is for an online assessment that is part of a course, likely related to data science or programming.  The assignment seems to encourage the use of external resources and even hacking to solve the questions.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/5/d51f4ef2faa1d935371f7b95e9d49a85435b481d_2_690x388.png)

Dear Bhavanagv,

The scores have not been pushed to the dashboard yet. Ignore seek portal. Seek
portal will not have your submission or your scores because it is evaluated
externally from the seek portal.

Kind regards

I had submitted the assignment still it’s shwoing that my score is 0 and that
i have not submitted the assignment.

Can you please look into it as i had saved my answers as well timely.

![Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a UI element displaying recent saves in a video game or application. The background is a dark color (likely dark blue or black). Inside a lighter, dark green bordered box, is the title "Recent saves" in a light green color.

Below the title, there are three lines, each representing a save:

*   Each line begins with a blue button labeled "Reload".
*   Following the "Reload" button is the text "from 2/2/2025," followed by the time of the save (9:04:58 PM, 9:04:53 PM, and 9:04:51 PM respectively, in descending order of most recent).
*   The final piece of information on each line is "Score: 4".

The save points are identical except for the time.

Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside
your seek portal.

The scores will only be visible in the dashboard. Just ignore anything inside

As stated in multiple places in discourse as well as in live sessions, The
final score is always your last submission.

There are some errors in grading for GA2 and GA3 for TDS, even after
submitting the assignments score 0 was given and the seek portal displayed
assignment was not submitted given that the login was from my own account and
was submitted before the time and still got a score of 0.

and the same happened for the 3rd assignment



![Here's a description of the image based on the provided OCR text:

The image is a screenshot of an online quiz interface. The quiz appears to have ended on Wednesday, February 5, 2025, at 11:59 PM IST, with a current score of 0. There are "Check all" and "Save" buttons at the top.

A set of numbered instructions is presented to the user, including:

1.  The user is encouraged to learn the material, but can skip questions.
2.  Answers can be checked using a "Check" button.
3.  The user should save regularly using a "Save" button. Multiple saves are allowed, with the last submission being evaluated.
4.  Reloading is permitted. Answers are saved in the browser, not on the server. Questions won't change except for randomized parameters.
5.  Browser issues may be resolved by turning off security restrictions or trying a different browser.
6.  The user is allowed to use any resources, including the internet, ChatGPT, friends, or libraries/frameworks.
7.  Hacking the code to get answers is also allowed.

A note states that multiple servers are running simultaneously to handle checking and saving.

A call to action directs users to join a discussion on Discourse for questions. The user is logged in as "23f2000232@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". A "Logout" button is present.

Finally, a section titled "Recent saves" displays a list of previous saves with timestamps and scores, indicating which save is the official score. The timestamps show saves from February 5, 2025, at 11:29:19 PM (Score: 6), 11:29:07 PM (Score: 6), and 11:00:34 PM (Score: 4.5).

Only 1st Graded assignment scores are visible on dashboard. I have submitted
2nd and 3rd GA before the deadline but still it showing “not submitted” on the
seek portal…



---

I recently got mail and checked my marks for GA2 and noticed that the final
score is showing as **4.25** , but while attempting the assignment earlier, I
had scored **7.25** shown after submission.

Could you please help me understand how the marks were reduced? I want to
ensure there was no error or misunderstanding in the evaluation.



---

Hi Satish,

Your last submitted score is the only valid score. You have to check before
submitting that the score is correct. There is a reload button to load
previous answers. But some answers require a live service. If the live service
is not running at the time of the check (when you hit the submit button), you
will not be scored for those questions. Please make sure that you have any
live services running when the submit button is used and check that the last
saved score is correct.

Kind regards
