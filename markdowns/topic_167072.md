Hi Vikram,

This is because (if you watched the session, or examined the code, you would
have realised that) datagen.py was designed to run inside your docker
container. And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you
ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will
normally be called by evaluate.py  
Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the
Dockerfile  
which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your
docker image and create the /data folder.

So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow
the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project
successfully):

  1. You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000
  2. You create a docker image that runs this application server.
  3. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.
  4. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:  
evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running
these two scripts.

  5. Run evalute.py using uv.

If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly
configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if
the application is producing the right result for each task.

Hope that gives clarity.

Kind regards
