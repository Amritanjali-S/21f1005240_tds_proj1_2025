what is the error here?? sir [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)



![Here's a description of the image, incorporating the OCR results and the error message:

**Description:**

The image shows a question asking "What is the JSON data?". Below the question, there is a code snippet enclosed in a box, which is presumably the JSON data in question. The data contains the following key-value pairs:

*   `"id"`: `"tt7144296"`
*   `"title"`: `"1. Kiss and Kill"`
*   `"year"`: `2017`
*   `"rating"`: `2.9`

There's a trailing comma after the last key-value pair (`"rating": 2.9`), making it syntactically incorrect JSON. Additionally, there's a loose `},` at the beginning of the JSON data, which further adds to its invalidity.

At the bottom of the image is an error message: "Error: Expected: 2.9 Actual: 2.9". This suggests that the test is trying to compare the rating field's value against the expected value of 2.9, but the JSON structure might be preventing successful parsing. It implies that the task/system understands what the value *should* be but is unable to correctly interpret or access it due to the JSON formatting issues.

**In summary:**

The image presents a question asking for the JSON data and shows what is *intended* to be a JSON object. However, the structure contains errors (extra beginning bracket and trailing comma) that would prevent it from being parsed as valid JSON. The error message hints at an attempt to extract the value of the rating field but failing due to the invalid JSON syntax.

[@22f3001315](/u/22f3001315) [@21f3002277](/u/21f3002277)
[@24ds2000024](/u/24ds2000024) – please try again after reloading the page.
The new error message will be clearer, like this:

    
    
    Error: At [0].rating: Values don't match. Expected: "7.4". Actual: 7.4
    

FYI, we expect all values as strings, not numbers. That’s because the year can
sometimes be a range for a TV series (e.g. 2021 - 2024) and the rating can
sometimes be missing.



---

In Question 2, it is specifically said to filter the movies however, the
evaluator is expecting a TV show there. Should we also include TV shows now?

edit: This is an everchanging dataset, so will our answers be saved, as, this
json might not be in this order tomorrow?



---

[@23f2000237](/u/23f2000237) A good point. Yes, please include _all_ titles.
I’ve reworded the question accordingly. Thanks.

I have a doubt regarding the bonus mark. Suppose someone were to get 10/10 in
the assignment, would their mark be recored as 11/10 or just 10?  
(Assuming they have interacted in this thread)

Anyone scoring 10/10 on GA4 and replying with a _relevant_ message on this
thread will get 11/10 ![:slight_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-

how to get the BBC weather API key?



---

Just a quick query on the Bonus mark.

Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full
score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and
would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to
that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?



---

[@JoelJeffrey](/u/joeljeffrey) It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the
final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the
total.

Have a step with your email id as its name. (Instead of checkout repository)  
Also make sure you give read and write permission so it commits without any

HOW TO GET BBC API KEY

![Here is a description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a screen capture of a coding assignment or challenge related to fetching and processing weather data from the BBC Weather API for Tel Aviv. The task is broken down into three steps:

1.  **API Integration and Data Retrieval**: This step involves using the BBC Weather API to fetch the weather forecast for Tel Aviv using a GET request to the locator service to obtain the city's locationId, including necessary query parameters such as API key, locale, filters, and search term (city).
2.  **Weather Data Extraction**: Using the obtained locationId, retrieve the weather forecast data by sending a GET request to the weather broker API endpoint with the locationId.
3.  **Data Transformation**: Extract the issueDate and enhancedWeatherDescription from each day's forecast and map each issueDate to its corresponding enhancedweatherDescription by iterating through the forecasts array in the API response, creating a JSON object where each key is the issueDate and the value is the enhancedWeatherDescription.

The image also presents an example of the desired output format as a JSON object where each key represents a date ("issueDate") and its value is a weather description ("enhancedWeatherDescription").
Below this example is a text box in which the code is to be written. A syntax error: "Unexpected end of JSON input" is written in the text box, indicating that the code is not valid JSON.

**Layout and Visual Elements:**

*   The interface appears to be a dark-themed code editor or online assignment platform.
*   The top bar indicates a due date (Sun, 9 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST) and a score (1/10), along with "Check all" and "Save" buttons.
*   Below the task description, there's a prompt: "What is the JSON weather forecast description for Tel Aviv?". This indicates that the user is expected to input the JSON output as described.

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a coding assignment that requires the user to interact with a weather API, extract specific information, and transform it into a JSON format.

The main content area displays the YAML configuration file for the workflow. Key elements of the file include:

*   **name**:  "23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"
*   **on:** section defines when the workflow is triggered, with a scheduled cron job that runs daily at 10:00 AM UTC and the possibility for manual triggering using "workflow_dispatch".
*   **permissions**: specifying "contents: write".
*   **jobs**: A job named "daily-commit" is defined.
    *   **runs-on**: Specifies the runner as "ubuntu-latest".
    *   **steps**: The job contains a series of steps, including a step to checkout the repository using "actions/checkout@v3", and another step named "Configure Git".

At the top right, there's a "Re-run all jobs" button.

At the bottom right, there's a message "Activate Windows" and the time and date are visible.

![Here's a description of the image, focusing on the key elements:

**Content:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a web form or application related to GitHub workflows. It provides instructions and prompts the user to input a repository URL. The interface is displaying an error message, likely due to an issue with the provided URL or the execution of the workflow.

**Key elements:**

*   **Instructions:** The text at the top provides guidance on creating and verifying a GitHub workflow, specifically mentioning the `.github/workflows/` directory.
*   **Repository URL Input:** There's a field where the user is expected to enter the URL of their GitHub repository, with a format example provided: `https://github.com/USER/REPO`.
*   **Error Message:** An error message is displayed below the input field, stating: "Error: No executed job step matches 23f2003853@dsstudy.iitm.ac.in".
*   **Button:** A "Check" button is present, likely used to validate the entered URL and associated workflow.
*   **Invalid URL:** The GitHub URL `https://github.com/23f2003853/workflows` in the input field is highlighted in red.

**Interpretation:** The image shows a user interacting with a system to configure or test a GitHub workflow. The error message indicates that the system is unable to find a matching executed job step based on the provided repository information, which likely means something went wrong in workflow execution. The error message also includes the email "23f2003853@dsstudy.iitm.ac.in", which suggests it is related to GitHub account.

the file (as there was no menu is available to run manually) (I checked with
Copolit AI it says it is not correct to have cron jobs in a directory, I am
not sure) (2) when I submit the url to iitm I got the following error

![Here's a description of the image, focusing on the relevant elements:

The image shows a form or application interface.  It includes:

1.  **Instructions:** Instructions for creating and using a workflow, including its location within the repository, how to trigger it, and verifications to perform.
2.  **Input Field:** A field labeled "Enter your repository URL (format: https://github.com/USER/REPO)". The user has entered the URL "https://github.com/23f2003853/workflows" into the field.
3.  **Error Message:** Below the input field, an error message is displayed: "YAMLParseError: Implicit keys need to be on a single line at line 1, column 1: <!DOCTYPE html>".

The overall impression is that the user has entered an incorrect repository URL or that the system has encountered an error while processing the URL, likely due to incorrect YAML formatting.

![Here's a description of the image based on the provided information:

**Overall:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web form or application. It shows an input field for a GitHub repository URL, an error message, and a "Check" button.

**Details:**

*   **Input Field:** The input field is labeled "Enter your repository URL (format: https://github.com/USER/REPO):" indicating that the user needs to provide the URL of their GitHub repository. The text box already contains the URL "https://github.com/23f2003853/workflows". There's a warning icon next to it, likely indicating an issue with the entered URL.
*   **Error Message:** The error message displayed reads "Error: No executed job step matches 23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". This suggests that the system couldn't find a matching job step associated with the email address '23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in' within the given GitHub repository.
*   **Button:** There is a blue "Check" button, presumably used to validate or process the entered GitHub repository URL.

In conclusion, the image illustrates a scenario where a user has entered a GitHub repository URL into a form, but the system has returned an error indicating that it cannot find a matching job step associated with the provided email address in that repository.

**Content Overview:**

The image presents a task description for a data analysis project. It outlines the steps required to extract, clean, filter, and calculate data from a PDF file containing student marks. The goal is to calculate the total Biology marks of students who scored 17 or more in Physics and belong to groups 43-66.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Task Definition:**  The image clearly defines the overall task at the beginning: "Calculate the total Biology marks..."
*   **Data Source:** It mentions the data is located in a PDF file named "q-extract-tables-from-pdf.pdf".
*   **Step-by-Step Instructions:** The image breaks down the task into four main steps:
    1.  **Data Extraction:**  It suggests using PDF parsing libraries like Tabula, Camelot, or PyPDF2 to extract the data.
    2.  **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**  It emphasizes converting marks to numerical data types.
    3.  **Data Filtering:** It specifies filtering students based on Physics scores (17 or more) and group membership (43-66).
    4.  **Calculation:**  It explains summing the Biology marks of the filtered students.
*   **Benefits and Context:** The image explains the value of automating this data analysis for EduAnalytics and Greenwood High School, highlighting benefits like identifying performance trends, allocating resources effectively, and enhancing reporting efficiency.
*   **Final Question:** The image concludes by reiterating the main question: "What is the total Biology marks of students who scored 17 or more marks in Physics in groups 43-66 (including both groups)?"

Hi Tushar,

If you looked at the PDF you might have realised that students have been
grouped. The question gives you a range for the groups 43-66. Including both
groups implies both group 43 and 66 are included in your calculation.

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
In ques 4 Scrap the BBC Weather API,  
I scraped the locationId for my city (i.e Mumbai)

and post that also mapped each `issueDate` to its corresponding
`enhancedWeatherDescription` .

The sample output mentioned was:  
The output would look like this:

    
    
    {
      "2025-01-01": "Sunny with scattered clouds",
      "2025-01-02": "Partly cloudy with a chance of rain",
      "2025-01-03": "Overcast skies",
      // ... additional days
    }
    

And My Output after scraping (And as explained by professor in Video 2 BBC
weather was)

{  
“2025-02-05”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-06”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-07”: “A clear sky and light winds”,

“2025-02-19”: “A clear sky and light winds”  
}

But it’s giving Error::  
Error: At root: Different number of properties

Can you please help how to fix this issue.

Issue resolved for me after following below step  
After creating the workflow:

  * Trigger the workflow and wait for it to complete
  * Ensure it appears as the **most recent action** in your repository
  * Verify that it creates a commit during or within 5 minutes of the workflow run



---

In place of “name: Setup up GIT config” change to “name: add commit
{your_email}”

use this [Google

![Here's a description of the image you sent:

The image is a screenshot of a web interface, likely part of an educational platform or coding challenge, related to converting PDF documents into Markdown format.

**Here's a breakdown of the elements:**

*   **Title:** The top of the image has text like "q-pdf-to-markdown.pdf" suggesting a file or task related to PDF to Markdown conversion.
*   **Instructions:** There are numbered instructions outlining the steps:
    1.  Convert PDF to Markdown
    2.  Format the Markdown using Prettier version 3.4.2.
    3.  Submit the formatted Markdown.
*   **Impact:** A section labeled "Impact" describes the benefits of automating the PDF to Markdown conversion process, highlighting how it contributes to EduDocs' mission and mentioning improvements to productivity, quality, scalability, and integration.
*   **Challenge Area:** Below the "Impact" section is a question or prompt: "What is the markdown content of the PDF, formatted with prettier@3.4.2?". There is a text box (likely for user input) containing Markdown-formatted text.
*   **Error Message:** Underneath the input text box is a message "Incorrect. Try again".
*   **Help Text:** Finally, there is some help text: "It is very hard to get the correct Markdown output from a PDF. Any method you use will likely require manual corrections. Reformatting with Prettier helps standardize the output format for comparison."

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a challenge where a user has to convert a PDF's content to Markdown and then format it using Prettier. The user's attempt was incorrect, and the platform provides some guidance on the difficulty of the task.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/7/f/7f9f1180300c81f729381ebb2a3391c53648a28f.png)

![Here's a description of the image you provided:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a screen capture of the GitHub Actions page for a repository named "TDS_GA_4" owned by "DigvijaysinhChudasamaTM." GitHub Actions is a feature that allows you to automate tasks in your software development workflow.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Navigation:** At the top, there's the GitHub repository navigation bar, indicating "Code," "Issues," "Pull requests," "Actions," "Projects," etc. The "Actions" tab is selected.
*   **Left Sidebar:** This contains a list of available Actions features like "All workflows," "Daily Commit," "Management," "Caches," "Attestations," "Runners," "Usage metrics," and "Performance metrics."
*   **Main Content Area:**
    *   **"All workflows" Title:** Indicates that the main area shows runs from all workflows within the repository.
    *   **GitHub Actions Feedback:** A blue banner appears, offering to help improve GitHub Actions. It encourages the user to give feedback through questions.
    *   **"15 workflow runs" Heading:** This indicates that there are 15 workflow runs displayed.
    *   **Workflow Run List:** Below this heading is a list of workflow runs, likely for a workflow named "Daily Commit." Each entry displays:
        *   The name of the workflow ("Daily Commit")
        *   Details about the run (e.g., "Daily Commit #15: Manually run by DigvijaysinhChudasamaTM")
        *   The branch associated with the run ("main")
        *   The run's status and the time it occurred. (e.g., "18 minutes ago, Successful runs, Failed runs, etc.")

**Functionality and Context:**

*   **Workflow Automation:** The "Actions" tab and workflow runs suggest that the user has set up automated processes (workflows) that are triggered by specific events (e.g., commits).
*   **Monitoring and Tracking:** The displayed run list enables the user to monitor the history and status of the automated workflows, understand which workflows are passing or failing, and troubleshoot issues.

**Additional Features:**

*   **Search Bar:** There is a search bar where the user can filter workflow runs.
*   **Event, Status, Branch, and Actor:** There are columns for each run.

In essence, the image shows a user's view into the workflow automation and execution history within a GitHub repository, allowing them to track, manage, and optimize their development process.

![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR and visual cues:

The image is a screenshot from a GitHub repository page, specifically showing the workflow runs section.

**Top Section:**

*   There's a banner at the top encouraging users to provide feedback on GitHub Actions. It says "Help us improve GitHub Actions" and includes a brief description: "Tell us how to make GitHub Actions work better for you with three quick questions". There's a "Give feedback" button and a close ("X") icon.

**Middle Section:**

*   Below the feedback banner, there's a header that says "71 workflow runs".
*   Table headings: 'Event', 'Status', 'Branch', and 'Actor'

**Bottom Section (Example Workflow Run):**

*   A workflow run is listed, identified by the name "23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in".
*   The workflow run appears to have been successful (indicated by a green checkmark).
*   A description below the workflow name indicates it was manually run by "23f2003853" and is workflow run #23.
*   The branch associated with the run is "main".
*   There are time stamps showing the run was initiated "23 minutes ago" and took "19s".
*   There is a "..." for more options.

**Overall:**

The image is a typical interface for displaying workflow runs within a GitHub repository, showing the status, timing, and details of each run.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/3/c/3c228c6f00a24b93336be15b4aa8f8c04c13f168_2_690x197.png)

In the question no. 10, I have tried numerous time to get it right markdown
content but it was incorrect all the time.

I have tried these steps:

    
    
    import pymupdf4llm
    md_text = pymupdf4llm.to_markdown("/content/q-pdf-to-markdown.pdf")
    
    import pathlib
    pathlib.Path("output.md").write_bytes(md_text.encode())
    

Then i run this in bash

    
    
    prettier --write output.md
    

And what i got frankly telling was far from this, I did some manual touchups,
and this what i have now. This is the best version i could come up with. Saw
the preview, it does matches with the pdf.

#Can someone please advise me a better approach?

![The image presents a programming task related to weather data. It outlines the steps of integrating with the BBC Weather API, extracting relevant data, and transforming it into a specific JSON format. An example of the desired output structure is shown.

The task then asks to provide the JSON weather forecast description for Osaka. A JSON snippet with weather forecasts for multiple dates in February 2025 is given as the user's answer.

However, the system flags an error: "Error: At root: Different number of properties." This indicates that the number of properties in the answer does not match the expected number, suggesting that the user might have either included too many or too few dates/forecasts.

**Image Description:**

The image is an emoji. It's a yellow face with a wide, open-mouthed grin. There's a single bead of sweat dripping from the left side of the face. The eyes are curved in a way that suggests either amusement or nervousness. This emoji typically conveys a sense of nervous laughter, awkwardness, or trying to laugh off a stressful situation.

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Sir the question 10 of the Graded Assignment 4 is very
tough I have tried everything from custom python codes using different
libraries to online converted and also formatted using prettier. Please sir
guide me how to do the question.



---

Yep figured that, and after matching the data solved the error and got that
question correct.  
Though thank you.



---

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Sir I have done the question 2 of the graded assignment
but I am very curious to know why the answers language gets periodically
change. Is there some kind of backend code which is responsible for that or is
something else ?



---

Yes we’ll were facing this issue.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir mentioned yesterday that they will change the
question.

"We will be changing this question. Even we found it hard
![:sweat_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/sweat_smile.png?v=12)

So need to worry about that question for now.



![Here's a description of the image:

*   **Subject:** The image depicts an emoji.
*   **Appearance:** The emoji is a yellow face with a wide, open smile that shows its teeth and tongue. It also has slightly closed eyes, creating a laughing or amused expression. A single blue droplet is present, positioned near its forehead.
*   **Meaning:** The emoji is commonly interpreted as expressing nervous laughter, a sense of awkwardness, or a mixture of amusement and anxiety.
*   **Background:** The background is solid black, which makes the emoji stand out prominently.](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/sweat_smile.png?v=12)

OK, that is good to hear, you won’t believe that yesterday I was trying this
question for 2 hours literally, it can be more also.



---

I was stuck at that question for 2 days, I tried multiple ways but was not
able to format the content with prettier as expected, every time I was getting
the error “Incorrect. Try again.”



---

On popular demand, I’ve made Q10 of GA4 easier (converting from PDF to
Markdown). The question remains the same, but the check is more liberal and
the error messages are more helpful. Please give it a shot now.

(FYI, one person _did_ solve it. A colleague, not someone from the IITM DS
program.)

Hello Sir, i tried but unfortunately after extracting the contents and
formatting the contents and submitting it, it’s showing various errors like
Missing links, Missing tables…

But on checking the file i wasn’t able to find any single table in the
contents in that case what could be done to fix these errors?

same issue with me as well

Sir I checked the pdf file, there is only one place unorder list is given and
the same is available in my answer. But the system throws error Missing List

![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR output:

**Image Description:**

The image contains a snippet of text and what seems to be an error message. The main text section is a list, most likely intended to be a markdown list. The items in the list are:

*   cuppedia tamquam facilis confugo
*   conservo depereo
*   consectetur arx
*   aeternus celebrer

Below this is an error message that reads: "Error: Missing lists".

**Overall Context:**

The image appears to be related to a task involving markdown formatting, possibly within a software environment like a document editor or content management system. The error message indicates that there might be an issue with how the markdown list is being rendered or interpreted by the tool being used. The request at the top is: "What is the markdown content of the PDF, formatted with prettier@3.4.2?". The image's objective is to have the image content rendered as markdown.

![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR and visual elements:

**Content Overview:**

The image displays text that appears to be a mix of Latin and potentially some generated or nonsensical words, suggesting the use of a "Lorem Ipsum" style filler text or a poorly OCR'd document. There are multiple paragraphs and lists of words. The overall appearance is that of a document with different sections or potential auto-complete words.

**Specific Observations:**

*   **Top Paragraphs:** The beginning paragraphs seem to have a slightly more coherent (though likely still nonsensical) structure compared to later parts.
*   **Word Lists:** The image has sections containing lists of single words.
*   **Bulleted List:** There's a bulleted list (using dot characters) with phrases ending with `depraedor`, `adopto`, `rerum` and `comes`.
*   **Bottom Text:** Larger font size texts with the phrases `Cuppedia uberrime socius atque paens` and `Sto theca testimonium aestus debitis`. These are not well formed phrases.
*   **Autocompletion**: `cresco vomito` and `deputo ceno` seems to show a feature of autocompletion.
*   **Style:** The text appears to be in a plain font, possibly used for a simple document or a web page layout example.

**Overall Impression:**

The image is likely a sample or placeholder document containing Latin-esque text and some fragmented phrases, possibly intended for design purposes (web design mockups, template creation) or perhaps derived from flawed OCR.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/c/5c7b1a8077a70f4a4dc9a91b49a22dd26d960153.png)

I think the idea behind this font is to make it difficult for people to
manually work on the markdown file from scratch. I guess they want us to use
the tools (like PyMuPDF4LLM, markitdown) they provided as resources to convert
pdf into a markdown and then may be we can do some manual intervention to make
it to the result as the scraping tools are not 100% accurate.

Could be another reason too. TAs’ can feel free to pitch in.

![Here is a description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of a dark-themed interface, possibly a code editor or learning platform, focused on an exercise involving Markdown conversion from a PDF document.

At the top, the title "Impact" is displayed, followed by a descriptive paragraph explaining that the exercise contributes to EduDocs Inc.'s mission of providing high-quality, accessible educational resources by automating PDF to Markdown conversion.

A bulleted list highlights the benefits of this automation:
- Enhances Productivity: Reduces time and effort in documentation preparation.
- Improves Quality: Ensures standardized formatting, enhancing readability and professionalism.
- Supports Scalability: Enables handling of larger documentation volumes.
- Facilitates Integration: Integrates Markdown-formatted documents into various digital platforms.

The question posed is: "What is the markdown content of the PDF, formatted with prettier@3.4.2?"

Below the question, there is a text area containing Latin text, presumably representing the content extracted from the PDF:
Audax teneo centum cilicium vigor venio.
Patria credo tonsor.
Defessus pax volup vomito creator video campana cedo vita votum.
Laudantium victoria aer via tepidus.
Adulescens corporis triumphus coruscus sordeo trans dolorum.
...

An error message "Error: Missing links" is displayed below the text area.

Finally, a note clarifies that achieving perfect Markdown output from PDFs is difficult and requires manual corrections. The exercise focuses on checking a few basic elements.

In the pdf you see some blue color font for specific words write that word in
format

    
    
    [word](#)

  1. There are only four texts which look like link texts in the pdf.  
All four properly coded in link markdown syntax, in the preview, they appear
as link texts same as in pdf.

Link text

Even after chaning all the 4 texts which appered in blue color in the pdf to
link texts,  
below error is still observed.

Error: Missing links

Did anyone else face same issue ?

  2. Also, no text in the pdf looks like a code block.  
But, Missing Code error was seen and after changing one of the paragraph by
using markdown code syntax that error is gone.

Appreciate any suggestions on the link error.



---

Replace actual text to expected text until you got correct



---

same kind of error is arising with me too.Any suggestion what is wrong with
it??



---

the rating should be treated as string.  
Format is as “2.9” instead of number 2.9



---

Yes it can be done. Got the 10th one correct by implementing breakpoint by
printing the expected answer which is being used to validate the user answer
in the js script.

Error: At [18].title: Values don’t match. Expected: “19. Graymail”. Actual:
“19. The Recruit”

this kind of errors for some titles, even though i only applied Rating filter
and nothing else, then why i’m getting different titles then the test cases?



![Here's a description of the image, combining the visual elements and OCR results:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a computer screen displaying a web browser with multiple tabs open. The prominent tabs relate to IMDb, a website for movie information, and a developer console, suggesting someone is analyzing or extracting data from IMDb.

**Left Side - IMDb Content:**

*   **Tab Focus:** The IMDb tab appears to be focused on searching for titles with user ratings between 4.0 and 8.0. This is indicated by the URL `imdb.com/search/title/user_rating4,8`.
*   **Movie Listings:** A list of movie titles and related information is displayed on the left side of the screen:
    *   **Anora:** (2024, 2h 19m, rating 7.8)
    *   **Blink Twice:** (2024, 1h 42m, rating 6.5)
    *   **Back in Action:** (2025, 1h 54m, rating 5.9)
    *   **Flight Risk:** (2025, 1h 31m, rating 5.5)
    *   **The Recruit:** (This movie is partially visible at the bottom)
*   **Descriptions:** Short descriptions of each movie plot appear beneath their titles.

**Right Side - Developer Console:**

*   **JSON Data:** A developer console is open, displaying JSON-formatted data. It appears to be extracted data related to the movie titles shown on the left.
*   **Data Structure:** Each entry in the JSON data contains the following fields:
    *   `id` (presumably an IMDb movie ID)
    *   `title` (movie title)
    *   `year` (release year)
    *   `rating` (user rating)

**General Observations:**

*   **Purpose:** The image suggests a process of extracting movie data from IMDb, potentially for data analysis or another application.
*   **Environment:** The screenshot is taken on a Mac operating system, as evidenced by the dock at the bottom of the screen. The time in the upper right corner says "Sat Feb 8 12:36 AM".

In essence, the image captures someone working with IMDb movie data, extracting information and examining it in a structured format.

Can someone please help me on this ?



![Here's a description of the image, including its content and layout:

**Overall Impression**

The image is a screenshot of a dark-themed interface. It appears to be part of an interactive tutorial or challenge, likely related to using the GitHub API. The user is being asked to find and format data based on specific instructions.

**Content Breakdown**

*   **Instructions:** The text at the top outlines the overall task: finding GitHub users in Seattle with over 120 followers and determining when the "newest" user's profile was created.

*   **Process Steps:** Three steps detail the process:
    1.  API Integration and Data Retrieval
    2.  Data Processing
    3.  Sort and Format (emphasizing the use of the created\_at date and ISO 8601 format).

*   **Impact Section:** This section describes the benefits of automating the data retrieval and filtering process, highlighting:
    *   Targeted Recruitment
    *   Competitive Intelligence
    *   Efficiency
    *   Data-Driven Decisions

*   **Input Field:**  A prompt asks the user to "Enter the date (ISO 8601, e.g. "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z") when the newest user joined GitHub." There is an input field where the user has entered "2011-05-07T08:30:48Z".

*   **Error Message:** Below the input field, there is an error message: "Incorrect. Try again."

*   **Additional Instructions:** There are more specific directions at the bottom: "Search using location: and followers: filters, sort by joined descending, fetch the first url, and enter the created\_at field. Ignore ultra-new users who JUST joined, i.e. after 2/7/2025, 11:00:55 PM."

**Layout and Visual Elements**

*   Dark background
*   The text is clearly structured with headings, numbered lists, and bullet points.
*   The layout is designed to guide the user through the task step-by-step.

**In essence, the image depicts a problem-solving exercise involving data retrieval, manipulation, and formatting using the GitHub API.** The user has attempted to provide an answer in the specified format but has received an error message and further instructions.

[@21F1005510](/u/21f1005510) Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names.
For example, [The Recruit](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/) is [also
known as Graymail in
India](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/releaseinfo/?ref_=tt_dt_aka#akas).
My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual
corrections for a few titles.

**Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated?** Because this
is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to
create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in
automation.

![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR and visual details:

**Image Description:**

The image shows a question related to weather forecast data in JSON format. The question is: "What is the JSON weather forecast description for Sao Paulo?". Below the question is a JSON object containing weather descriptions for different dates:

```json
{
"2025-02-08": "Partly cloudy and light winds",
"2025-02-09": "Thundery showers and a gentle breeze",
"2025-02-10": "Sunny and a gentle breeze",
"2025-02-11": "Thundery showers and light winds",
"2025-02-12": "Sunny intervals and a gentle breeze"
}
```

Below the JSON object, there's an error message: "Error: At root: Property name mismatch".

Finally, at the bottom, there is a "Check" button.

Essentially, this looks like a question within an educational platform or tool where the user needs to provide the correct JSON weather forecast description, and the error message suggests that the user's input (likely the displayed JSON) is not matching the expected format or content.

This is the only thing which worked for me.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir, can I suggest to replace the snapshot of example
output which expects the year to be an integer and the ratings as to be floats
(instead of actual evaluation which expects them to be strings). Also, it
would help to clarify that “Movie 1” should carry the numerical prefix as
reported in IMDB. The current example on the portal is:

The first movie has an ID of "tt1234567", a title of "Movie 1", was released in 2021, and has a rating of 5.8.  The second movie has an ID of "tt7654321", a title of "Movie 2", was released in 2019, and has a rating of 6.2.

Your dot of 2.9 may be the dot from alphabet or numeric one  
Try to copy the value and then replace it

Try to copy the error data  
The problem might be off dot  
check one dot is on right of m and other right of 0 in keyboard  
these two dots may represent different meanings

is it resolved?

Sir, In Graded Assignment - 4 >> Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,”
whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted
several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the
year field.

I use different classes to extract values for various fields. Could there be
any other element on the portal affecting this extraction?

In Q4, one of my classmates is encountering a “root property” error despite
using the same extraction method as I do. Upon checking, I found that this
issue occurs because the city’s time is displayed as the previous day compared
to our time. The portal results seem to be based on the city’s actual time
rather than IST.  
I would appreciate your guidance on these issues.



---

Good idea [@23f2005138](/u/23f2005138) and thanks. I fixed this. The example
now reads:

    
    
    [
      { "id": "tt1234567", "title": "Movie 1", "year": "2021", "rating": "5.8" },
      { "id": "tt7654321", "title": "Movie 2", "year": "2019", "rating": "6.2" },
    

… with the year and ratings quoted.

I guess for the year part, there are certain series having multiple seasons,
for which hyphenated “years” are given.

For the particular instance - `“2024–”`, it appears another season/part is
announced, thats why it is written that way.

Thanks [@21f2000709](/u/21f2000709) for this information. I figure out where i

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir,  
I don’t understand this error. In the website, the movie name doesn’t have a
colon “:”, but in the result it is expecting so.

For this question, you may use the Google Colab file referenced in the
assignment. This file will provide you with the date and description.
Additionally, you can generate a weather location ID for the city specified in
your assignment. Using this ID, you will obtain the weather URL, which you can
then use to verify the date and description.



---

here is the difference of ‘:’ in the expected ans. so make it manually correct
. i did the same and got correct ans .  
and in the question also it is mentioned that may be manually you need to
correct. just give a try.



---

run your console script again and match the description.



---

yes, same happened with me . correct it manually.

Why question 4 starts failing. It was working correct yesterday. Because of it
I am getting 9/10 marks.



![Here's a description of the image based on the provided OCR and context:

The image is a screenshot of an interactive coding or data science task, likely from a platform like DataCamp or a similar educational tool. The context focuses on weather data integration for AgroTech Insights, a company involved in agricultural technology.

**Here's a breakdown of the elements:**

*   **Title:** "Weather Data Integration for AgroTech Insights"
*   **Introduction:** Explains AgroTech Insights' mission and the importance of accurate weather data in agriculture.
*   **Task Description:** The user is tasked with developing a system to automate weather data fetching and processing using the BBC Weather API.
    *   **Steps Involved:**
        1.  API Integration and Data Retrieval: Get weather forecast data for Manila from the BBC Weather API using necessary parameters.
        2.  Weather Data Extraction: Retrieve weather forecast data using the obtained locationId.
        3.  Data Transformation: Extract the `issueDate` and `enhancedWeatherDescription` and create a JSON object where the `issueDate` is the key, and the `enhancedWeatherDescription` is the value.
*   **Example Output:** Shows how the JSON output should be structured, with dates as keys and weather descriptions as values.
*   **Question Prompt:** Asks the user "What is the JSON weather forecast description for Manila?".
*   **User Response Area:** The user has provided a JSON object (likely in a text area) as a response, providing weather forecast descriptions for several dates in Manila.
*   **"Check" Button:** Allows the user to submit their answer for evaluation.

In summary, the image showcases a practical coding exercise involving API integration, data extraction, and JSON data transformation in the context of agricultural weather forecasting.

The result is dynamic with changes made in the API. So try re-executing your
code today and it will automatically solve. Your code is right ! Just make a
re-run and things will work out ![:slight_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-

**The image shows a standard yellow smiley face emoji.**

*   It has two simple, round, black eyes.
*   It has a gently curved black line representing a smile.

It's a simple, classic representation of happiness or contentment.

try running the console again and it will work, make sure the data matches
with the one in api as it changes regularly

Thanks!.  
It is working now. I had to manually correct 5 movie titles to get it correct.

What 's the solution?



![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR results:

The image shows what appears to be a JSON data snippet. The data represents an object with the following keys:

*   `"id"`: Value `"tt10078772"`
*   `"title"`: Value `"9. Flight Risk"`
*   `"year"`: Value `"2025"`

There is an error message displayed below the JSON data:

"Error: At [10] year: Values don't match. Expected: "2025-". Actual: "2025-""

This error indicates that the expected value for the "year" key and the actual value are not matching at a certain point in the data. Based on the error message it might have to do with the 10th index position.

Titles (from the output json) should be replaced by the titles which shows in
the error message “Expected”. It can only be done manually. There may be
multiple titles need to be translated by this method.

Please refer the instruction.

you can manually add space after the hyphen



---

I face the same error, also thinking of issueDate, the value seems to be
constant in every loop inside forecasts array (is it because the data is issed
on that particular date) that gives same issue date key across the json
outcome. Anyways the new json with same issueDate also gives the same Root
error



---

Double-check that the rating field in the JSON is indeed a float (`2.9`) and
not a string (`"2.9"`) in your code.



---

That is perhaps to ensure we don’t manually write the markdown for the pdf.
Converting the pdf to markdown and getting the correct output is extremely
hard, I tried doing that multiple times yet wasn’t able to get that right by
the original method.

But since it is mentioned that the GAA is hackable and we are allowed to do
so, for some of the questions, therefore you can try solving that by
establishing a breakpoint in the sources and then write the code in the
console to get the expected output.



---

Write the code referencing the provided collab file and make sure to use the
API key  
The output actually changes once in a while so you might need to run the code
a few times before getting in right

![Here's a description of the image, focusing on the relevant details:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of an interactive programming assignment or tutorial related to JSON data structures. The task is to provide a JSON weather forecast description for Los Angeles. The user has attempted to input a JSON structure, but it's resulting in an error.

**Top Section:**

*   There's a box illustrating the desired output format using example JSON. This sample shows a JSON structure where each key is a date string (e.g., "2025-01-01") and the corresponding value is a weather description string.

**Main Section (Problem Area):**

*   The user has entered their JSON data in the large text box. The data is enclosed in curly braces `{}` which is good.
*   The user has entered data where each date value is like `“25-02-16": "Sunny and light winds",`
*   The error message "Error: At root: Property name mismatch" indicates a formatting problem preventing correct JSON parsing.

**Format of JSON Data:**
```json
{
"2025-02-16": "Sunny and light winds",
"2025-02-17": "Sunny and light winds",
"2025-02-18": "Sunny and light winds",

How to actually do the HNRSS one…i can’t find much.



---

How did u do the links? I’m unable to do links



---

Just copy paste the expected value in place of actual value in json. Keep
doing this eventually it would be the answer would be correct.

This is a format issue when the json is scrapped from the browser.

Request help on Q4 aboutBBC weather data, the instructions in the question
tell us to use BBC broker API and get issueDate & enhancedWeatherdescription
value pairs. However, it seems there are only 2 unique values of issueDate

Code:

    
    
    import requests
    
    url = "https://weather-broker-cdn.api.bbci.co.uk/en/forecast/aggregated/" + getlocid('Bogota')
    response = requests.get(url)

    print(f"The number of days data is {len(json_data['forecasts'])}")
    
    weather_data = {}
    
    for i in range(len(json_data['forecasts'])): # Use range to create an iterable sequence of indices
      issue_date = json_data['forecasts'][i]['summary']['issueDate']
      weather_description = json_data['forecasts'][i]['summary']['report']['enhancedWeatherDescription']
      weather_data[issue_date]=weather_description

Yes …due to the location difference the search results are different for
everyone therefore you need to adjust it accordingly  
It might need around 6-7 amendments

The API is returning 14 days of forecast data, as evidenced by the output
However, the issueDate values are not unique for each day. Instead, they
represent the time when the forecast was issued or updated.  
In your output, there are only two unique issueDate values:  
2025-02-08T04:00:00-05:00  
2025-02-08T16:01:58-05:00  
This means the forecast was updated twice on February 8, 2025, once at 04:00
AM and again at 4:01 PM (both in EST timezone) …To get a unique weather
description for each day, you need to modify your approach by using the actual
forecast day for each day instead.

While submitting solution, do I need to keep all the local servers
running/local URLs like 127.0.0.0 stuff, else I am getting one question as
correct & the other one mentions unable to fetch data!? So that means I need
to run them in different different ports?



---

I posted this error message but now the first issue got resolved but I am
still keeping it in my post so that if anyone faces same issue, they can try
if they can fix it similar to how it worked for me.

Please help with the second issue.

  1. For Q8, the workflow is running on Github and commiting the scraped results to the json file (which is so amazing for me btw!). But I am getting this error for my public repo.  
How it got resolved: I set up fixed time for cron schedule instead of every 5
min. Now it works.

> Error: No daily scheduled triggers found in workflows.

  2. I had all correct results for Q1 to Q7 till yesterday but it keeps giving errors even when I reload same file for some questions. Do I need to keep addressing those errors or if once correct and saved, I can ignore those?

I have tried several times but still recieving this as error. Please help



![Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a snippet of code, likely JSON data, within a dark-themed interface. The prompt asks "What is the JSON data?". The JSON seems to represent a list of movies, with each movie having properties like "id", "title", "year", and "rating".

The JSON array contains entries like "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", "Fight Club", and "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring". 

Below the code snippet is an error message that reads "Error: At [0].id: Values don't match. Expected: "tt20221436". Actual: "tt0437179"". This suggests that there's a validation issue, and the "id" value of the first movie in the array (index [0]) doesn't match the expected value.

I’m able to see the markdown response for different countries for question 3,
GA 4 on my browser but I’m unable to submit it probably because of network
issues. Can someone help me with a fix. Thank you.



![The image shows a web development debugging scenario. The user is working on an API that fetches data from Wikipedia based on a country query parameter. The task description outlines the steps:

1.  **API Development:** Choose a web framework and create an API endpoint that accepts a country query parameter.
2.  **Fetching Wikipedia Content:** Find the Wikipedia URL and fetch the page's HTML.
3.  **Extracting Headings:** Use an HTML parsing library to extract headings from the page.
4.  **Generating Markdown Outline:** Convert the extracted headings into a Markdown format.
5.  **Enabling CORS:** Configure CORS headers to allow GET requests from any origin.

The user has entered the URL `http://localhost:8000/api/outline` in the input field. However, the error "TypeError: Load failed" is displayed.

The Chrome DevTools console reveals CORS issues. The messages indicate that the browser is blocking requests to `http://localhost:8000/api/outline?country=The+Bahamas` due to access control checks. It also indicates the mixed content issue since the page at `https://exam.sanand workers.devitds-2025-01-ga4` (HTTPS) is trying to load content from `http://localhost:8000/api/outline?country=The+Bahamas` (HTTP). The error messages include "Fetch API cannot load...", "Not allowed to request resource", and "[blocked] The page at ... requested insecure content from...". The error messages all point to a CORS configuration issue or a mixed-content policy block.

how to tackle this error as in 10 th movie year is 2025 but it is showing 2021



![Here's a description of the image, focusing on its content and the error presented:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a task submission screen for an assignment, likely related to data management and streaming service content acquisition. The user is asked to submit JSON data, but an error is occurring because the "year" value doesn't match the expected value.

**Breakdown:**

1.  **Task Instructions:** The top portion outlines the assignment: "4. Submit: Submit the JSON data in the text box below." It explains the assignment's purpose – simulating a streaming service's content licensing strategy to enable informed decisions for StreamFlix.

2.  **Data Input Area:** A text box is provided for entering the JSON data. The JSON appears to represent information about a movie or TV show, including:
    *   `"id"`:  The IMDb ID ("tt26584495")
    *   `"title"`:  The title of the movie ("10. Companion - Die perfekte Begleitung")
    *   `"year"`: The year the movie was released.
    *   `"rating"`: The rating the movie received.

3.  **Error Message:** A critical error message is displayed: "Error: At \[10] year. Values don't match. Expected: "2021-". Actual: "2021"" This indicates that the validation of the JSON data is failing because the "year" field is expected to be '2021' but it currently contains the value '2025'.

4.  **Disclaimer:** Below the error, there's a disclaimer stating that IMDb search results can vary by region and may change, suggesting the data scraping process might be unreliable. It suggests that manually translating titles or re-running the scraper code could be necessary.

**In essence:**

The image depicts a data validation error in an assignment related to content licensing for a streaming service. The submitted JSON data contains a "year" value ("2025") that doesn't match the expected value ("2021"), causing the validation to fail.

![Here's a description of the image, focusing on the error and code context:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a screenshot of a Python code environment (likely Jupyter Notebook or a similar IDE) where a program has encountered an `IndexError`. The error occurred while trying to access an element within a nested list/dictionary structure returned by an API call.

**Code Snippet Highlights:**

*   **Date Handling:** The code begins by generating a list of dates and then formats them into `YYYY-MM-DD` strings.
*   **Data Mapping:** It appears the code is mapping dates to weather descriptions, potentially pulling weather data for a range of dates.
*   **JSON Conversion:** The code converts a Python dictionary (`weather_data`) into a JSON string for output or storage.

**Error Context:**

*   **Error Type:** `IndexError: list index out of range`
*   **Location:** The error occurred on line 24, within the line defining `weather_url`.
*   **Problem:** The error suggests that the code is trying to access an element at index `[0]` within the `result['response']['results']['results']` list, but the list is either empty or doesn't have enough elements.

**Possible Causes of the Error:**

1.  **Empty Result List:** The most likely cause is that the API call to retrieve location data returned an empty list for `'results'` within the nested JSON structure. This would mean that `result['response']['results']['results']` is an empty list, and trying to access `[0]` would cause the `IndexError`.
2.  **Unexpected API Response:** The API may have returned a different structure than expected, meaning the path `result['response']['results']['results']` is incorrect.
3.  **Conditional Logic Missing:** The code might be missing a check to verify that the `results` list has at least one element before attempting to access `[0]`.

**In summary, the error indicates that the code is attempting to access an element of a list at an index that does not exist, likely because the list is empty or the API response structure is not what the code expects.**

I didn’t get any error for Astana.  
The error may be due to incorrect loops in your code that’s why it’s going out

![The image shows a Jupyter Notebook, likely running in a Google Colab environment, focused on scraping weather data from the BBC website. The notebook is titled "bbc-weather-scraping.ipynb"

Key observations include:

*   **Data Display:** A section of the notebook displays weather data, with columns for the date (e.g., "25-02-16"), high temperature (e.g., "-11"), low temperature (e.g., "-14"), and a summary of the weather conditions (e.g., "Thick cloud and a gentle breeze"). This section appears to be the result of data processing, likely from a web scraping operation.
*   **Code Snippet:**  Below the data display, a line of code is visible: `df.to_json(orient='records')`. This code suggests that the data frame (`df`) containing the scraped weather data is being converted into a JSON format, specifically with the `orient='records'` parameter. This orientation presents the JSON data as an array of objects (records), where each object represents a row in the data frame.
*   **JSON Output:** The output of the JSON conversion is displayed directly below the code. It is a long string representing a JSON array. Each element in the array is a JSON object that contains key-value pairs for 'Date', 'High', 'Low', and 'Summary', corresponding to the columns of the scraped weather data.
*   **Colab Environment:** The interface indicates that the notebook is running in a Colab environment (or similar), with options like "+ Code", "+ Text", and "Copy to Drive." There are also resource indicators for RAM and Disk usage.  A "Share" button and user profile icon are visible.
*   **Next Steps:** Buttons labeled "Generate code with df", "View recommended plots", and "New interactive sheet" are visible, suggesting the user is being prompted to further explore the data or create visualizations.
*   **Unicode:** The JSON output shows escape sequences like `\u00b0` and `\u80b0`.  `\u00b0` is likely intended to represent the degree symbol (°), and `\u80b0` is another Unicode character that might be a result of encoding issues during scraping or processing.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/1/011280b40bf86e32b458005e1fa0a98d3213106f_2_690x260.png)

It worked for me; only 4–5 values caused errors, which I fixed manually.
Additionally, I corrected the console code, which now provides the correct
result.

what is this magic trick… please elaborate …

    
    
    Error: At [10].id: Values don't match. Expected: "tt16027074". Actual: "tt8008948"
    

i dont see that value in data …



---

You can manually edit that. I also have to manually edit one entry to get the
correct answer.



---

Hi,  
As mentioned in the question, you have to sort by “joined” so it should be
“<https://api.github.com/search/users?q=location:Seattle+followers:>>120&sort=joined&order=desc”



---

There are two “Vienna”. The question4 is referring to which one?



---

Manually make correction in your answer as provided in the error message. If
no such words are available insert those and check



---

check if the action is commited



---

try copying the expected result and pasting it inside the quotations



---

Check the log of the daily commit .



---

Ahh, I have the same doubt too!



---

For the links, this format worked for me:  
[ < link text > ] (#)



---

Yes I got it now. Thank you!



---

it should be “2.9” instead of 2.9



---

looks like formatting or the passed conditions have some issue… can you check
and verify it once and see?



---

Error: At [3].title: Values don’t match. Expected: “4. 365 Days - Noch Ein

{“id”: “tt21106646”, “title”: “4. The Next 365 Days”, “rating”: “2.9”, “year”:
“2022”}

my result , there is no any entry with “4. 365 Days - Noch Ein Tag” on IMDB



---

I am getting missing links as error in the 10th question. How to do it?



---

Mine is giving 1/10 on running without even writing anything? This is
happening for Q3? Is it just a glitch?



---

Yes happened to me too, refresh the page, mine got fixed!



---

Check you pdf you can find a word with blue colour and underline. Give some
dummy link and use link mark with the word



---

Best way to solve Q2 is , look at the network tab in dev tools and get the url
used for assessment and get data from it .



---

u have used a apace (_) after 2.9 which is not visible at front that’s why it
is throwing error , it should be just (“2.9”) not ("2.9 ")



---

Agreed and I have tweaked my approach to get the correct answer. But I feel
the question instructions should be adjusted accordingly - the question says
to get every issueDate and enhancedweatherDescription key value pair - but
only 2 such pairs exist ; whereas in the final answer it is forecast date &
weather description total 14 pairs.

Hi Team,

I have made the JSON from the IMDB website using JS, But do i miss any filter
conditions,

I took first 25 films which 5 to 6 rating, but json seems to be different.

Could anyone please tell me what i did wrong here?



![The image displays a code snippet, seemingly JSON data, along with an error message related to a title mismatch. 

Here's a breakdown:

*   **JSON Data:** The code block contains data with the keys "year", "rating", and "id" along with their values. It has values "2024", "6.0", and "tt30292390" respectively.
*   **Error Message:** The error "At \[10] title: Values don't match" indicates a discrepancy in the title of a movie. The expected title is "11. Sebastian Fitzeks Der Heimweg," while the actual title found is "11. The Calendar Killer."
*   **Additional Notes:** The text below the error suggests that IMDb search results may vary by region, requiring manual title translation or periodic scraper code updates.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/6/7/67d552f9ef5b8b06cae0421fe8d91bcdf4352af7_2_690x127.png)

The image is a screenshot of a multiple-choice question related to Markdown formatting. The question asks: "What is the markdown content of the PDF, formatted with prettier@3.4.2?".

The answer options are presented in a dark grey box, and the selected answer is:

```
|adficio|chirographum|
|---|---|
|vitae|ipsam|
|spectaculum|claudeo|
|comes|celebrer|

Decumbo decumbo suadeo totidem apto.
```

A green checkmark indicates that this answer is correct.

Below the answer area, the text "Correct" confirms the selection. A note explains that getting accurate Markdown from a PDF is difficult and often requires manual corrections, but this question only checks for a few basic elements.

In the 10th question, how do we add headings and links to the markdown
output?(getting error: Headings missing)



---

first convert it roughly to md file then use ai and tell it to add (all the
errors one by one). and slowly it will solve all the errors

yes i know it is not the correct way to convert pdf to md file but its just a
way to trick the checking system.

but i have an issue it gave me error that it does not contains the word “bash,
javascript, whole redesign, net, suasoria” which is not in the actual pdf, but
i added it and it worked. it was just pure trial and error.



---

this is a changing dataset so make changes to your answer accordingly and you
will get it correct



---

Do the necessary changes as it is said below as it is an everchanging dataset.  
You will get the answer correct once you make the changes asked after
checking.



---

check you code and do the changes like max_latitude  
replace [0] to [1]

The image shows a snippet from what appears to be a web development tutorial or exercise. The top part of the image presents a section with titles and subheadings, perhaps an example output of some sort. Below this, a numbered list outlines the steps involved in building a web application.

The steps listed are:
1. API Development: Suggesting the use of a web framework like FastAPI to create an API endpoint.
2. Fetching Wikipedia Content: Instructions to find and fetch the HTML of a country's Wikipedia page.
3. Extracting Headings: Suggesting the use of an HTML parsing library such as BeautifulSoup or Ixml to parse the fetched Wikipedia page and extract headings.
4. Generating Markdown Outline: Converting the extracted headings into a Markdown-formatted outline.
5. Enabling CORS: Configuring the web application to include CORS headers.

Below the instructions, there's a question asking for the URL of the API endpoint.  An input field shows a URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/outline?country=france`.  Underneath, there's an error message "TypeError: Failed to fetch", which indicates that the provided URL is not working or accessible.

Respected Sir,  
How can I Solve this, I’m not able to solve this one



![Here's a description of the image:

**Overview:**

The image is a screenshot of a coding assignment or exercise focused on extracting data from Hacker News using its RSS API. The context involves a company named "TechInsight Analytics" that monitors technology trends and wants to automate the process of identifying relevant Hacker News posts.

**Content Breakdown:**

1.  **Title/Problem Statement:**  The assignment, worth 1 mark, asks the user to "Search Hacker News". It specifies that the task involves finding the latest Hacker News post mentioning "WebRTC" and having at least 30 points.

2.  **Introduction (TechInsight Analytics Description):**  The text describes TechInsight Analytics and their need to monitor Hacker News for technology trends. It mentions the use of the HNRSS API and the need for a tool that can identify, filter, and extract data from Hacker News posts.

3.  **Requirements:**
    *   "Topic Monitoring": Monitoring topics like "Artificial Intelligence", "Blockchain", or "Cybersecurity"
    *   "Engagement Filtering": Finding post that have received at least a minimum number of points
    *   "Data Extraction": Extract essential details

4.  **Tasks:**
    1.  "Automate Data Retrieval": Use the HNRSS API to fetch the latest Hacker News posts with filtering by points.
    2.  "Extract and Present Data": Extract the most recent `<item>` and get the `<link>` inside it.
    3.  "Share the result": Type in just the URL in the answer.

5.  **Your Task:** The user is instructed to find the link of the latest Hacker News post mentioning "WebRTC" and having at least 30 points, specifically using the Hacker News RSS API.

6.  **Answer Field:** There is an answer field where the user can input the URL they believe is the correct answer. The answer field contains the text "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41699323" with an "Error: Incorrect link"

7.  **Interactive Elements:**  The image includes a "Check" button, suggesting that the user can submit their answer and receive feedback.

**Overall Impression:**

The image represents a task or challenge in data extraction, web scraping, and working with APIs. It's likely part of a larger course or tutorial focused on using the Hacker News RSS API for data analysis.

Hi,  
For the 4th question, We can get the necessary information issueDate and its
description from Summary itself right? or am I seeing the stuff in the wrong
place?



---

Change it manually.  
add the expected answer



---

when you press ctrl+c it turns off the server and same goes for refresh.  
also you dont need to manually write ?country… just write till outline and
turn on the server n you are good to go.



---

ok this is fine for now and its showing correct also but at the time of
evaluation will my server runs??



---

It is written in the ques to get the link in the link tag. Not the post link.

Thank you bro, I will try this

not at all. your last saved marks will be considered

just replace value instead of it. same problem I also that time I check code
and modify serval time I faced same error. so just ignore it and replace
expected value instead of actual value in our Json.

extract the pdf to markdown format using chatgpt then add links,tables and one
blockquote

Try to use the key ‘enhancedWeatherDescription’ parsing through the summary
object (or) use the BeautifulSoup to find ‘div’ with attributes of  
class: wr-day-summary

Hi, please ensure that your repository is public, if private the response
would be 404. If workflow runs is not found, it might be that the number of

tried after reloading the page but still i am getting  
Error: At [11].year: Values don’t match. Expected: “2024”. Actual: "2024– "



---

You have to manually change these thing  
from actual change to expected.  
For me, error was almost 10 times.



---

on your 11th or 12th instance change it  
write the actual value



---

If you have submitted on the assignment site and saved it in time, then that
score is the actual score and will be updated directly on the student
dashboard.



---

Your answer is correct. Just add a space after the hyphen—it will resolve the
problem. Or you can copy and paste from here: '2025– '.

Hi Team ,

Are we expecting the result to match exactly as per the benchmark of qa4.



![Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a snippet of what appears to be JSON data. The data includes a "title," "year," and "rating" for a movie or TV show. The values are:

*   "title": "1. The Night Agent"
*   "year": "2023-"
*   "rating": "7.5"

There's an error message at the bottom of the image, indicating a mismatch in values. Specifically, it complains about a "title" mismatch, expecting "9. Incorrect answer jalement invités" but finding "9. You're Cordially Invited" instead. This suggests the program may be parsing the data incorrectly.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/3/03c2659de1532aefc02ea8eaa831c0955bf85b5d_2_690x131.png)

@all, in q4 Actually the answer data is sync with current weather description
therefore the answer changes. Make sure to update your json file before
submitting.

i 'm here for the bonus marks,

But since i am here. Just want to appreciate the course and your efforts
towards this.

We need more “teachers” like you, who really puts an extra effort in the
course.

And i have never seen any course cool as this,

  * like appreciating tweaking things, using dev console to tweak things, keep the code checks on client side (_and as S Anand’s Student i have leveraged that freedom![:sweat_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/sweat_smile.png?v=12) , gave client side answer checks’s code to `o1` and it reverse engineered the minifed code, and lots of question were solved by that only, but really curious on how others are doing this_)
  * keeping the cutting edge tech in course, like function calling from OpenAI.  
( _i have seen some students solutions, they were using regex to solve that
problem![:smiling_face_with_tear:](https://emoji.discourse-

*   **Expression:** It has a wide, open-mouthed smile, almost a laugh. Its eyes are curved and squinting.
*   **Sweat Droplet:** A single, blue sweat droplet is present, usually positioned above one of the eyebrows.
*   **Meaning:** This emoji, often called "Grinning Face with Sweat", is used to express nervous laughter, relief that something is over, or awkwardness. It can also suggest trying to laugh something off or feeling overwhelmed but attempting to stay positive.](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/sweat_smile.png?v=12)

Below this is another box titled "Bonus marks for posting on Discourse," explaining that IITM BS students who reply to the "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]" with a relevant question or reply will get 1 bonus mark.

Underneath that, it indicates the user is logged in as "22f2001394@ds.study.iitm.ac.in.", and there's a "Logout" button.

Finally, there's a section titled "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)," listing several entries with "Reload" buttons, dates and times (all in 2025), and scores (10 and 8). This suggests the webpage is related to a graded assignment or activity.

why everytime question 2 answer is showing error in json?



---

What error are you getting [@Abhay222](/u/abhay222) ?

Can you post a screenshot or error details ?



---

Is it safe to skip Q4 for those who got the city named Nur-Sultan, since it
has been renamed to Astana, and the answer for Astana is incorrect in the
portal?



---

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)  
There is possibly wrong evaluation in q6 as it is taking in 2nd latest link as
the correct answer. I might be wrong, but the latest one is giving me
incorrect evaluation while the 2nd latest is giving me the correct score.



---

getting the same issue Error: At [12].year: Values don’t match. Expected:
"2024– ". Actual: “2024”



---

yes this kind errors.



---

[@Abhay222](/u/abhay222) [@22f3002184](/u/22f3002184)

if you look closely the expected value is `2024- ` and actual that you are
supplying is `2024`.  
Difference ? your value does have a `-` and a space at the end.  
reason ? you might be scraping it ? `trim()` or maybe using `innerText` to get
tag’s text ?



---

it seems we are intended to provide country specific versions for Individual
students simulating being an analyst for MNC in various locations. Clearly you
got Spain and I seem to have gotten France, although it doesn’t seem to be
mentioned in the question itself.



---

Thank you Tanya for pointing out this issue.  
Just tell me this, has your city changed? If yes then what was it earlier and
what is it now.



---

any reply regarding this please

*   **Background:** The background appears to be an indoor setting that looks like a shop or café. There are some indistinct shapes and colors suggesting furniture, merchandise, or décor. The background is blurred.

Alright so in Q4 of W4, We have to extract weather forecast data from bbc
servers for a given city. The city I have been given Nur-Sultan is not present
in the bbc data base, it appears the city is now known as Astana and is listed
in the bbc database as Astana.  
Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database, all of my attempts to
extract data for it were meet with failure. So I extracted the data for Astana
and pasted it in the portal but that doesn’t work as well and throws the
following error “TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading
‘id’)”  
What am I suppose to do? [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)

![Here is a description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of a programming challenge or coding quiz related to weather data retrieval and transformation. The task involves using the BBC Weather API to fetch and process weather forecasts for Nur-Sultan (formerly Astana).

**Key elements in the image:**

1.  **Challenge Instructions:** The top part of the image outlines the steps involved in the challenge:
    *   API Integration and Data Retrieval: Use the BBC Weather API to get forecasts for Nur-Sultan.
    *   Weather Data Extraction: Retrieve the forecast data using the location ID.
    *   Data Transformation: Extract `issueDate` and `enhancedWeatherDescription` from the forecasts array. Map each `issueDate` to its corresponding `enhancedWeatherDescription` to create a JSON object.

2.  **Example Output:** An example is shown to illustrate the desired JSON output structure. The JSON keys are the issue dates, and the values are the corresponding weather descriptions.

3.  **Input Area:** There is an input area where the user is expected to provide the JSON weather forecast description for Nur-Sultan. The image shows an attempt to provide the answer.

4.  **Error Message:** At the bottom, there is an error message that says: "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')". This means the code attempted to access the `id` property on an object that was `undefined`. This usually happens when you are trying to access data that doesn't exist.

In summary, the image depicts a coding challenge related to fetching and transforming weather data, and it highlights a specific error encountered while attempting to solve the problem.

The image is a screenshot of a task or challenge related to data retrieval and extraction using the Hacker News RSS API. The goal is to find the link to the latest Hacker News post that mentions "WebAssembly" and has at least 86 points.

2.  **Extract and Present Data:** Extract the most recent `<item>` from the API results and get the `<link>` tag inside it.
3.  **Share the result:** Type in just the URL in the answer.

At the bottom of the image, there is a question prompt asking "What is the link to the latest Hacker News post mentioning WebAssembly having at least 86 points?" and a text entry box that shows a user's attempt to input the answer (an incorrect URL) along with the error message "Error: Incorrect link".

![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR and visual elements:

**Content:**

The image shows a question "What is the JSON data?" followed by what appears to be a snippet of JSON data. The data consists of an array of objects. Each object represents a movie or show, with fields like "id," "title," "year," and "rating."

*   **Examples:**
    *   `{"id":"tt8999762","title":"5. The Brutalist", "year":"2024","rating":"8.0"},`
    *   `{"id":"tt27657135","title":"6. Saturday Night", "year":"2024","rating":"7.0"},`
    *   `{"id":"tt17526714","title":"7. The Substance", "year":"2024","rating":"7.3"},`
    *   `{"id":"tt10919420","title":"8. Squid Game", "year":"2021-2025","rating":"8.0"},`
    *   `{"id":"tt21227864","title":"9. Un matrimonio di troppo","year":"2025","rating":"5.5"},`

The snippet of JSON data looks cut off.

**Error Message:**

Below the JSON, an error message is displayed.

*   `Error: At [10] year: Values don't match. Expected: "2021-". Actual: "2021-"`

The error message suggests a data validation problem, specifically related to the "year" field in the 10th item of the array. It expects to start with "2021-", but the format seems to be incorrect.

**Visual elements:**

The text is displayed in a dark theme (background). The code and error messages are contained within a red highlighted border. There is also a scroll bar on the right of the border.

In summary, the image shows a question about a snippet of JSON data, along with an error indicating that the data does not conform to the expected schema or rules.

*   **Figures/Characters:** There appear to be multiple figures, possibly soldiers or warriors, with what look like helmets or headgear. They seem to be armed with some kind of weaponry.
*   **Environment:** The background suggests a natural or potentially alien environment. It has a hilly or mountainous horizon and a forest or grove of trees. The ground seems to have a reddish hue.

**Colors:**

*   The color palette consists of various shades of greens, reds, grays, and possibly some blues or purples.

**Overall:**

The image depicts a scene with armed figures in a stylized, possibly alien or fantasy environment. Due to the low resolution, it's difficult to make precise details, but it likely portrays a group of soldiers or warriors in some kind of landscape.](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/22f3000804/48/87428_2.png)

Thankyou , but now i am getting missing code error. What it means?
[@23f2000573](/u/23f2000573)



---

You just have to add a space after a hyphen



---

Check if you are using table formating where there is a table, also there is
perhaps a code block in the pdf where a small section of text is in different
font than the rest.



---

No there is no code block in the pdf. Now i m getting missing code error. Why
this error can arise [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)



---

I am also facing the same error in this question



---

the answer format is correct the link is probably not the latest one, I had
the same issue because my code was working only for the first 100 entries… you
should try paginating your code so it can cover more entries



---

just change the values as itis coming in the error



---

change the name manually as the name is diiferent on imdb according to the
region, I had the same issue…



---

are you able do it now? Reload and check



---

yes facing the same thing



---

you are missing code block

Normal : print(123)  
Code Block : `print(123)`

you can refer to week 2 q1 for the syntax of code block

anyone have idea about this error?



![The image shows a question asking "What is the JSON data?" followed by a string of text that appears to be attempting to represent JSON data. The text describes a list of movies, each with properties such as title, year, rating, and sometimes an "id". However, the format is incorrect for valid JSON. At the bottom of the image, there's an error message "TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'textContent')", indicating a problem with accessing data within the code.

I’m assuming it’s occurring because the text formatting for the JSON is
incorrect. Try and put it in the correct format

I’ve reloaded a dozen time and even extracted the data again and again to
account for any changes but it still doesn’t work.

the graded assignment is showing like i didn’t submit it. please check on
this.



![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR and visual elements:

**Overall:** The image shows a screen capture of what appears to be an online assignment platform or learning management system (LMS). The theme is dark, with a predominantly dark green or grey background.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Header:** A red banner at the top indicates the deadline for the assignment: "Ended at Sun, 9 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST". It also shows the current score as "Score: 0" and buttons for "Check all" and "Save".

*   **Bonus Announcement:**  A section highlights bonus marks for posting on "Discourse". Specifically, IITM BS students who engage with the "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]" discussion by asking a relevant question or providing a reply will receive 1 bonus mark on the graded assignment.

*   **Login Information:**  The text "You are logged in as 23f3000975@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." displays the user's login email address. There is a "Logout" button below this.

*   **Recent Saves:**  A section titled "Recent saves" shows a history of submissions or saves, indicating they represent the official score. The history lists dates and times, along with the corresponding scores. The specific dates and times are "9/2/2025, 8:04:05 pm. Score: 8", "9/2/2025, 8:03:25 pm. Score: 8", and "9/2/2025, 4:03:58 pm. Score: 4". Each of those listings has a "Reload" option.

In summary, the image is a screenshot of an online assignment platform, displaying information about bonus marks for participating in a discussion forum, user login details, and a history of saved scores for the assignment.

![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR and the visual cues:

**Overall:**

The image is a screenshot of a webpage, likely from an online learning platform. It shows a course page with a sidebar for navigation and the main content area displaying information about a "Graded Assignment."

**Left Sidebar:**

*   It's a navigation menu for different modules or sections of the course.
*   The following modules are listed:
    *   Module 2: Deployment Tools
    *   Module 3: Large Language Models
    *   Project 1
    *   Module 4: Data Sourcing (which is currently selected)
    *   Graded Assignment 4 (appears under Module 4)
    *   Module 5: Data Preparation

**Main Content Area (Graded Assignment 3):**

*   The title is "Graded Assignment 3" (but the sidebar shows the page of assignment 4)
*   It states that the due date for the assignment has already passed.
*   The due date is specifically mentioned as "2025-02-05, 23:59 IST."
*   It provides information and troubleshooting tips for accessing the graded assignment, including:
    *   Disabling ad blockers
    *   Enabling cookies
    *   Ensuring JavaScript is enabled
    *   Using Chrome Browser
    *   Disabling interfering browser extensions
    *   Dealing with overly aggressive anti-virus software
*   A strong warning: "You MUST use your Student Id (eg. 22f3xxxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) to do the Graded Assignment, otherwise your score will not be considered for evaluation."
*   A link to Graded Assignment 3 is provided: "https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga3"

**In summary:** The image shows a course page where the due date for a graded assignment (likely Graded Assignment 3 or 4) has passed. It gives essential instructions for students to access the assignment, including technical troubleshooting steps and a crucial requirement about using their student ID.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/6/c/6c41591b6b3db0e9e48a14f4e11e3a21719ee2ce_2_690x307.png)

As you can see in this screen shot i already tried this question and getting
error so i posted it on discourse. But still i did not get any marks for
attempting this question.  
i got only 9/10.



![Here is a description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of a discussion thread on a platform, likely related to a data science course (GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]). The thread appears to be focused on a specific error encountered in a coding assignment.

The discussion thread is initiated by a user "A" with ID "22f2000008". "A" is reporting an error they are encountering repeatedly when running code in a Collab environment, specifically for the city "Nur-Sultan". The error message displayed in the screenshot indicates a "NameError: name 'location_id' is not defined". This error is highlighted in a traceback, pointing to line 35 of a Python cell where a variable named "location_id" is being used within an f-string to construct a URL for the BBC Weather website. The code snippet suggests the user is trying to fetch weather data for Nur-Sultan, but the "location_id" required to form the URL is not defined in the code.

The image also shows the side navigation with categories like "Courses", "Operational Issues", and "Professionals Corner", and a tag "clarification".

Hello [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir,  
As can be seen, my roll number is present in this list (21f2000588) and in GA4
I have got 10/10 but unfortunately, that bonus mark hasn’t been added (as can
be seen from the score displayed on the dashboard). So I request you to add
that bonus mark to the total kindly.

Hoping for a positive response.  
Thanks & Regards  
Digvijaysinh Chudasama

[@22f2000008](/u/22f2000008) Your roll number is in the list shared by
professor Anand.

**Overview:**

The image is a screenshot of a discussion thread within a learning platform (likely related to data sourcing in the GA4 context), with a dark theme. It shows several comments and interactions. The thread is titled "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]."

**Left Sidebar:**

*   A menu with topics like "Topics," "My Posts," "Docs," and "More."
*   A section titled "CATEGORIES" with courses, operational issues, and a "Professionals Corner".
*   A "TAGS" section with "clarification" being tagged.

**Main Content Area:**

*   **Top Post:** A comment by "rohitgarg" stating "ig, they have not updated. not reflected on my portal too".
*   **Main Discussion Thread:** "carlton," identified as "Course TA," replies to "@23f3002537, @21f3000745, @Jeleshiya" stating "Anyone who received the Nur-Sultan parameter for this question and at least attempted it will get a mark. Kind regards".
*   A final post from "22f2000008" with carlton replying to it.

**Additional Elements:**

*   Tags are present in the top right corner for announcement, term1-2025, graded-assignment, week-4, and carlton.
*   The date in the comments section spans from Jan 31st to Feb 18th.

if a student has 10/10 and his name is in the bonus list, how would that look
like in the dashboard?

I don’t think it is added in my case.

It will show up as 110 marks. Bonus marks are for all discourse posts on this
thread that Anand has identified as valid. I have provided operations team
with the update corrected scores. You will start seeing them in the dashboard
soon.

Also these are the list of students that have been affected by Nur-Sultan in
their questions. These will get an automatic mark for that question if they
attempted it. Note that this is not a bonus mark. This is a free mark.

For those who didn’t submit but still need to practice the questions like to
check if the answer is right, or cross-check the solutions for GA 4 and GA 5,
is there a special link where the portal just checks the answer and says right
or wrong. I wasn’t able to do GA4 or even try to attempt GA 5 before deadline,
but i would like to go through the process of submitting etc. is there any
link or solutions for GA 4 and GA5.



---

is there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the
deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for
learning sake. I understand that each set of students get different questions.
