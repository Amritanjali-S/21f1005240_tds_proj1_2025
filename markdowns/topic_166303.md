The lectures primarily focus on surface-level explanations without ensuring a
strong foundational understanding of the topics. Key concepts, such as Large
Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, are not explained in a
structured manner, making it difficult for students to follow.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir i watch live session recording , but still not
getting some useful from it , I am talking about week 3 content in llm , these
words are never heard by us so please try to tech from basic things please .
At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to
above of our head .

Hi Hari,

The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with
perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science.
Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at
least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded
Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions
were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a
conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is
always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This
is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We
cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or
not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students.
The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and
well attended.

Have you watched this session in particular?

If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just
introducing it

followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases

But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand
it? That depends on the student.

Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them
because only then can we address gaps in understanding.

Kind regards

The image is a stylized graphic with a light orange border. Inside the border, there's a collection of colorful, flat design icons related to data and technology. These icons include graphs, charts, a globe, connected nodes, a computer screen, a target, and pens, arranged in a visually engaging way.

Overlaid on this background is a semi-transparent dark blue rectangle with rounded corners. The text "WEEK 3" and "SESSION 1" are written in large, bold white letters within the rectangle, indicating the subject of the graphic, likely related to an educational course or workshop.

![The image is a screenshot of a computer screen, showing a video call in progress alongside a web browser window.

On the left side, a web browser (likely Opera based on the icon) is open. It displays a custom "speed dial" or homepage with various website shortcuts. The background of the browser is an orange color with a stylized image of a Naruto-like character in the background. Website shortcuts, displayed as rounded rectangles, include titles like "amit-", "DS Discourse," "App Dev II Project Doc...", "(159) Tools in Data Science...", "Java Tutorial | Learn Jav....", "Prime Number Progra...", "PDSA," "tds june 2024," and "MAD-2 resources."

On the right side, a video call interface is visible. A user named "Amit Kumar Gupta" is participating, with a placeholder profile image of a stylized flame. The screen background for the video call is black, indicating that the camera may be off.

At the bottom, the Windows taskbar is visible. It shows the Start button, a search bar, various application icons, system tray icons, and the date/time (July 11, 2024).

The overall image suggests someone is on a video call, possibly for work or study, while having relevant links and websites readily available in their web browser's speed dial.

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a screenshot of a computer screen, showing a combination of a web browser and a video call. The left side of the screen displays the content of a webpage within a Chrome browser, while the right side shows a video conference, likely a lecture or presentation.

**Web Browser Content:**

*   **Title:** IIT Madras May 2024 - TDS
*   **Topic:** The webpage focuses on "Data Sourcing."
*   **Course Structure:** A sidebar menu on the left indicates course modules including:
    *   Course Introduction
    *   Self Assessment
    *   Data Discovery
    *   Data Sourcing (currently selected)
    *   Data Preparation
    *   Data Analysis
    *   Large Language Models
    *   Project 1 & 2
*   **Data Sourcing Content:**
    *   Rating and Reviews: "5/5 (2 reviews)"
    *   Control Extraction Area and Saving Extracted Data: Specifying the need for accurate table extraction and data conversion.
    *   Links and References:
        *   PDF Scraping - Notebook
        *   Learn about the Tabula package
        *   Learn about the Pandas package
    *   Section Title: "Optional: Real-life scraping" describing a live scraping session.
    *   Screenshot of a website (emarketer.com), likely used as an example in the live scraping session.

**Video Call Content:**

*   The right side of the screen shows a video call featuring a person named "Carlton D'Silva."

**Operating System/Interface Elements:**

*   The bottom of the screen shows a macOS dock with various application icons.
*   The top of the screen shows the standard macOS menu bar and browser tabs, including titles like "Indian Insti," "Data sourcing," "TDS LLM," and "ChatGPT."

In summary, the image captures a student likely participating in an online data science course. The student is viewing a web page on data sourcing and simultaneously attending a related live session led by Carlton D'Silva.
