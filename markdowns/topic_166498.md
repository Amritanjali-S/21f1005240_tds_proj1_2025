Chat GPT has stepped up the game and I am excited

Now I can not only generate the code, but can run it and ask it to fix the
error with a single click. This changes software development and I guess we
are moving in the direction we all know. It also makes this course a lot more
important - the number of new things that I have learnt from this course which
I am able to directly apply to my day to day work is immense. Thanks to
[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) and the entire course team who designed this amazing
course

I hope ChatGPT solves deployment next

![Here's a description of the image:

The image is a simple, bright yellow smiley face emoji. It has two small, round, black eyes and a curved black line representing a smiling mouth. The emoji is set against a black background, which makes the yellow color stand out.

![The image shows a development environment, likely within a platform like Replit or a similar online code editor.  It's split into three main panes:

*   **Left Pane (Chat)**:  This pane shows a chat interface, likely with an AI assistant like ChatGPT.  The user is interacting with the AI to refine a solution. The AI indicates that it updated the code to handle environments without SSL by including a workaround for SSL configuration using `certifi` and checking the `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` environment variable, attempting to resolve a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ssl'` issue.

*   **Middle Pane (Code Editor)**: This pane displays Python code. It seems to be an API endpoint related to fetching Wikipedia page content and generating a Markdown outline. The code uses the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries. There are comments indicating code sections for fetching Wikipedia URLs, parsing HTML content, and extracting headings.

*   **Bottom Pane (Console)**:  This pane displays console output, specifically traceback information, suggesting an error has occurred. The error seems to originate from the `starlette` library. It specifically notes an import error: the `ssl` module could not be found.

The overall impression is that the user encountered an SSL-related import error while running their code. The AI (ChatGPT) attempted to resolve it by suggesting a workaround but it does not seem to have fixed the underlying problem as the error still appears in the console output.  The final line indicates that the "Run successfully". It's either an artifact or the app might have another means of reporting execution success.
