Could you send me your email id. thanks.

Hi, the same issue persists for me for GA 2 and 4. I also did not attemp GA 3.
Please look into this. My email id: 24ds3000061@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

My Graded assignment results are also not appearing in the dashboard. My email
id is 22f2001532@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

[@24ds3000061](/u/24ds3000061) [@22f2001532](/u/22f2001532)

Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the
scores have been pushed.

GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual
(i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be
made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.

Kind regards

Thanks Carlton. Now the results are visible in the dashboard.

Thanks

*   **Server Requirement:** Another note states that multiple servers need to be running simultaneously while checking or saving answers, potentially indicating a complex infrastructure.
*   **Discussion Forum:** A prominent teal-colored box encourages users to join a discussion on Discourse if they have questions.
*   **Login Information:**  The user is logged in with an IITM email address (23f3001731@ds.study.iitm.ac.in). There's a "Logout" button.
*   **Recent Saves:** A section displays recent saves, showing dates/times and a score of 7.5 for each. The label states that the most recent save is the "official score."
*   **Question:** The question section displays "1. LLM Sentiment Analysis (1 mark)"

I can’t be able to enclose another screenshot of week-2 ( marks-5) as I was a
new user.



![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR and the provided crops:

The image is a screenshot of a webpage related to an IITM BS program, likely an online course platform. The page has a red header at the top indicating a deadline: "Ended at Sun, 9 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST."  There's also a hamburger menu icon.

The main content of the page includes:

*   **Bonus Marks Announcement:** A green box highlighting that IITM BS students can earn bonus marks for participating in a specific discussion on Discourse.  The discussion is titled "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]".  To earn the bonus, students must reply to the discussion with a relevant question or reply.

*   **Login Information:** The page confirms the user is logged in with the email address "22f3000370@ds.study.iitm.ac.in."  There's a "Logout" button nearby.

*   **Recent Saves:** Another green box displays "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)". Below there are three rows detailing when scores have been saved/updated, along with a "Reload" button:

    *   09/02/2025, 08:43:03. Score: 8
    *   09/02/2025, 08:42:59. Score: 8
    *   09/02/2025, 07:57:15. Score: 7

Essentially, the page informs a student about a bonus mark opportunity, confirms their login status, and displays recent score updates.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/7/9/7901577c51f1b3786c79c1857af15f328aaae2df_2_291x499.png)

*   **Person:** A man with short, dark hair and a beard is visible in the circular video feed. He's wearing a yellow t-shirt with some text on it.
*   **Background:** The background of the video feed appears to be outdoors. Trees and a bridge-like structure are visible.
*   **Google Meet Elements:** The Google Meet logo is in the top-right corner. The name "Gokul Vasudevan S" is in the bottom-left corner, likely the name of the person in the call.

![The image features a graphic design with a central focus on the text "WEEK 5 SESSION 1" in a bold, white font. This text is set against a dark blue, semi-transparent overlay that covers a significant portion of the underlying design.

The design underneath the overlay is a flat, vector-style illustration, incorporating various icons related to data, technology, and creativity. Elements like a compass, pencils, a computer screen, circuits, bar graphs, a globe, network diagrams, and various chart types are present. These icons are rendered in a color palette that includes teal, red, yellow, blue, and beige.

The entire design is framed by a beige border with orange accents. The style of the design suggests it might be used for educational or informational purposes, potentially as part of a presentation or a learning module.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/9/b990ffaadbfcbad12d865c514f3d6b48e5bc7cf2.jpeg)

The image is a digital graphic that seems to be a title card or introductory slide. A navy blue rounded rectangle obscures the center of an illustrated background. Within this rectangle, the words "WEEK 5" and "SESSION 3" are displayed in large, bold, white font, stacked vertically.

The background appears to be a stylized, illustrative pattern with a color palette including shades of blue, orange, yellow, and some red accents. It seems to be related to data analysis, technology, or presentations, featuring elements like charts, graphs, a world globe, network diagrams, and stationary. The overall presentation style is modern and geometric.

The entire graphic has a slightly retro or vintage feel, particularly due to the color scheme and the flat design style of the illustrations.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/3/9/3919680685030c27cce9018b86e59128c7487ff6.jpeg)

The image is a screenshot of a webpage related to an online course or assignment. The webpage has a dark background with a red header section. The header indicates that the assignment ended on Sunday, February 9, 2025, at 11:59 PM IST, and the current score is 0. Buttons for "Check all" and "Save" are also visible.

Below the header is a section titled "Bonus marks for posting on Discourse." This explains that IITM BS students who reply to a relevant question or reply in the "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]" will receive 1 bonus mark on the graded assignment.

The next section confirms the user's login status with the email address "23f1002510@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" displayed. A "Logout" button is available.

At the bottom of the screenshot is a section labeled "Recent saves" with the text "(most recent is your official score)". Three records of saves are listed, each with a "Reload" button, the date "09/02/2025", and timestamps, with a score of 2 for each save.

*   **First Field:** "tds-2025-01-ga1" (appears in all rows)
*   **Second Field:** "22f3000935@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" (appears in all rows)

I have checked the backend server. The actual score is 85 in Module 1.

Ignore seek portal, because scores are evaluated externally on our server.
Those scores on seek portal are just from the placeholder question that asked
whether you saw GA1 and attempted it. It has no bearing on your actual marks.

The actual score will be in the dashboard soon.

*   **User Login:**  It displays the logged-in user's email address: `22f1001901@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`, along with a "Logout" button.

*   **Questions:**  A "Questions" section lists a few assignment questions.  One question is "Write documentation in Markdown (1 mark)", and another is "Compress an image (1 mark)."
