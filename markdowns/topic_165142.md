I wanted to seek clarification regarding the deadline for GA2. The latest
email received today mentions the deadline as 26th January, whereas an earlier
email stated 2nd February, which is also reflected on the dashboard.

Could you please confirm the correct deadline to avoid any confusion?

The image is a screenshot of an email. The sender's address is "donot_reply@study.iitm.ac.in" and the email was sent to "25t1_se2002-announce". The email's timestamp shows "12:23 PM (7 minutes ago)".

The body of the email contains the following message:

"Dear Learner,
The deadline for the Week 1 & 2 Graded Assignment is 26/01/2025 23:59 Hrs.

Warm Regards,
IITM BS Team"

In essence, it's an automated reminder about an assignment deadline.
