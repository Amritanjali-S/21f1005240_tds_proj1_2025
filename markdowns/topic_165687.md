I will be at the IIT Madras campus next Wednesday (5 Feb) from 10:30 am to
2:30 pm IST.

I’ll be at the NAC (New Academic Complex) or the NAC footsteps.

If anyone would like to chat - about TDS, or anything else - you’re welcome.

![Here is a description of the image:

**Content:** The image contains a profile of a person named Anand S., who is identified as the CEO of Gramener.

**Text:** The profile includes the following details:
*   Anand is a co-founder of Gramener, a data science company, and leads a team that tells visual stories from data.
*   He is recognized as one of India's top 10 scientists and is a regular TEDx speaker.
*   He is a gold medalist from IIM Bangalore and an alumnus of IIT Madras, London Business School, IBM, Infosys Consulting, Lehman Brothers, and BCG.
*   He has hand-transcribed every Calvin & Hobbes strip, is addicted to Minecraft (thanks to his daughter), and dreams of watching every film on the IMDb Top 250 (except The Shining).
*   He blogs at s-anand.net, and his talks are at bit.ly/anandtalks.

**Layout:** The name "Anand S." and the title "CEO, Gramener" are at the top in a larger font size. The word "Profile" is in a slightly different color and is underlined, acting as a heading for the profile description. The profile text follows in a smaller font size.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/3/c/3c4a546e7bae08a17f873f828185df45aa57f717_2_690x451.png)

Thank you for taking out time to meet today. It was great to meet you Sir, and
was a great pleasant surprise to meet our wonderful TAs,
[@carlton](/u/carlton) and [@jivraj](/u/jivraj) (and, TAs for Java and
Statistics I too. sorry, I am unable to tag them with names) as well. I am
inspired to continue learning deeper and more… such interactions are very
helpful. Thank you.
