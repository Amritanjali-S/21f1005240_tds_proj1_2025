For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with
the next "  
Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as  
2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt  
eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt  
That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. [@carlton](/u/carlton)
[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or
209 → 210 is not working



![The image shows a task description for "Move and rename files" worth 0.5 marks. It involves downloading and extracting a file named "q-move-rename-files.zip". The task requires moving all files from within subfolders into a single empty folder using the `mv` command. Subsequently, each file needs to be renamed by replacing every digit in the filename with the next digit (e.g., a19b.txt becomes a20b.txt). The final question asks what the output of the command `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` would be when executed within that folder in bash.

Hi anant,

Question mentions every digit should be replaced by next one.

In that case 209 would get replaced by 310

Hello Sir, When I am following that logic to rename files, assessment check is
giving error “Incorrect. Try again.”

Hi Hisham,

Its described in the question. There is a hidden element hiding somewhere

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) please guide me through this question, my answer is
showing incorrect



![Here's a description of the image:

**Content:**

The image is a screenshot of a web page that appears to be an online CSS selector practice assignment or quiz. The user is working on a question that asks them to find all `<div>` elements with the class "foo" in a hidden section and calculate the sum of their `data-value` attributes. The user's answer of "482" has been marked as incorrect.

**Layout:**

*   **Top Bar:** Shows the browser address (exam.sanand.workers.dev...), tabs for the assignment, other courses, and a coding tutorial.
*   **Assignment Details:** Indicates a deadline (Sun, 26 Jan, 2025), the current score (8.75/10), and "Check" and "Save" buttons.
*   **Main Content:**
    *   A title related to CSS selectors.
    *   A brief description from the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) on basic CSS selector types.
    *   A link to a "CSS Diner" game for practice.
    *   The specific question about selecting `<div>` elements with class "foo" and summing their `data-value` attributes.
    *   An input field for the answer, with the incorrect submission of "482".
*   **Downloads Popup:** There is a popup window listing recently downloaded files: q-unicode-data.zip, README (1).md, Book 2(Sheet1).csv, q-unicode-data.zip, q-move-rename-files.zip.

Hi manmeet,

I don’t know about solution to this.  
Some network setting might be causing problem.

Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours
of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and
visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student
developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits
such as cloud resources and domains.

I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces
works very well if you have good internet connection.

2 days ago I attempted TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools and scored 8.5. I
didn’t submit as I wanted to attempt incorrect answer questions.  
When I logged in today it says score is 0.  
Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again?  
Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links?  
If [seek] ([Nptel
Seekh](https://seek.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/courses/ns_25t1_se2002)) can
access [TDS exam] ([Technical
Assessment](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1)) then why we need
to submit from seek?



---

The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It
does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that
they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence
the two stage verification. You still need to ![Screenshot 2025-01-13 at

the submissions to get a score for the GA.

The actual GA questions are on <https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/> via the seek
portal or  
on the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/) introduction page.

Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the
GAs.

As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score.
![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-

We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your
browser.  
Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted
them, it might have not loaded from our back end server.
[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) will be able to confirm the reason for this problem.

the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked
correctly.**

Thanks [@carlton](/u/carlton).  
I answered questions on <https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/> but didn’t click on
the button “Submit Answers” on seek as my answers for 2 questions were
incorrect.  
My question is whether I need to submit on seek to save answers on Exam? (I
checked my score and saved it on the exam site.)



---

Hi [@Nelson](/u/nelson)

Your answers on the [exam](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/) site that have
been submitted will be saved and used as the basis for your score. Saying
yes/no on seek does not materially impact scoring. Its just an awareness
question. Even if you answered yes on the seek portal, you can still revise
your answers on the exam site. The final submission is always whats locked in
for the score (until the deadline passes).

Kind regards

It might be because you are not adding up the correct tags with attribute
`data-value`. There may be other tags within the same DOM and having the
attribute `data-value`.

![Here's a description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a computer screen showing code and a video or presentation on the right.

**Left Side (Code):**

*   There's a text editor or IDE displaying Python code. The code seems to be related to reading CSV and text files, detecting their encodings, processing their content, and calculating a sum based on specific criteria.
*   The code includes:
    *   Reading CSV files in binary mode to detect encoding using `chardet`.
    *   Reading a text file similarly.
    *   Handling potential encoding errors (`UnicodeDecodeError`).
    *   Reading data from the files.
    *   Concatenating the content of multiple files into a single string.
    *   Splitting the content into lines.
    *   Iterating through each line, splitting it into symbol and value, stripping spaces.
    *   Checking if the symbol matches specific criteria.
    *   Converting the value to a number and adding it to a total sum.
    *   Handling potential `ValueError` and `IndexError` exceptions.
    *   Printing the final sum.
*   At the bottom, there are input prompts for file paths ("Enter the path to the first CSV file", etc.) and the final output "The sum of all values associated with the specified symbols is: 31512.0"

**Right Side (Video/Presentation):**

*   There's a frame showing a video or presentation titled "COMPUTER STUFF THEY DIDN'T TEACH YOU."
*   The topic seems to be related to "Code Pages, Character Encoding, Unicode, UTF-8 and the BOM."
*   A person is visible in the video, presumably the presenter.
*   Below the video, there are some instructions: Download and process the files in the zip archive, which contains three files. Instructions related to what is expected from each one: CSV file encoded in CP-1252, UTF-16 and CSV file encoded in UTF-8. It mentions each file having two columns: symbol and value.

**Interpretation:**

The image suggests someone is learning about character encodings and how to handle them when reading and processing text files. The Python code is likely a practical exercise or a demonstration of how to automatically detect encodings and handle potential encoding issues when working with data from various sources. The video provides background information on character encodings.

Hi Shouvik,

Your code seems correct to me. I think there is an extra space before your
answer in input box.

Btw instead of using a while loop, there is a much more optimal, which uses
difference of dates and doesn’t require a loop at all. Try to figure it out.

kind regards

yeah thank you sir. now please say for the 2nd problem

Try copy pasting exact symbols `— OR † OR €` Can you share code in code block,
it’s difficult to read symbols that are present.

Also have a look at what `all_content` variable contains, see if there are
some problem with content.

I had this same doubt, I tried by adding the “span” tag’s value too it showed
correct for me. I’d suggest you to try that.

Oh, good catch, [@23f2000237](/u/23f2000237) and
[@siva.bhaskaran](/u/siva.bhaskaran) \- I made a mistake in the evaluation

I fixed it. Note: None of the earlier answers are affected, i.e. if you got it
right earlier, it’ll stay right.

Hello Gentlemen Instructors,

In all the video lectures, I am first required to download the tools, install
them on my computer ? Is it not going to overload my computer’s RAM etc.,  
In one of the classes, you said that there is something - colab like cloud
wherein we can go and practice without overloading our own computers. Will you
please let me know how to go about it ??

In question 3 of GA-1 while checking the answer it’s showing incorrect answer.

216375D6F5A1DAF9EB6350251E9F0A7395A0B2988D58ED6E57D9568E8B1AD175

This was the output which I got after the execution of the given code in the
question.Kindly guide If I did some error or error in entering the value.



![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR output:

The image is a screenshot of a terminal window, specifically a PowerShell session. The user, "kaiff," is performing operations on a file named "formatted.md." The following actions are taken:

1.  **Get-FileHash**:  The `Get-FileHash` cmdlet is used to calculate the SHA256 hash of "formatted.md." The output displays the algorithm used (SHA256), the calculated hash value (216375D6F5A1DAF9EB6350251E9F0A7395A0B2988D58ED6E57D9568E8B1AD175), and the path to the file.

2.  **Prettier Formatting:** The user then uses the `npx` command to run `prettier` a code formatter, on a README file and redirects the output to update the "formatted.md" file.

3.  **Get-FileHash Again:** After formatting the file the  `Get-FileHash` cmdlet is run again to calculate the SHA256 hash of "formatted.md." The output displays the algorithm used (SHA256), the calculated hash value (216375D6F5A1DAF9EB6350251E9F0A7395A0B2988D58ED6E57D9568E8B1AD175), and the path to the file. Note that the hash value is the same as the hash value before reformatting.

4.  **CertUtil:** The user uses the `certutil` command to calculate the SHA256 hash of "formatted.md." The output confirms the SHA256 hash value (216375d6f5a1daf9eb6350251e9f0a7395a0b2988d58ed6e57d9568e8b1ad175) and indicates that the command completed successfully.

In summary, the image demonstrates the user calculating the SHA256 hash of a file, formatting a file using prettier, and then verifying the SHA256 hash again, using both PowerShell cmdlets and the `certutil` command. Also note the fact that the SHA256 hash value is the same before and after reformatting.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/4/a/4a91f864fac32edea97935f0456d5b93a5ebc4f4.png)

The dates are in the year-month-day format. Include both the start and end
date in your count. You can do this using any tool (e.g. Excel, Python,
JavaScript, manually).

![Here's a description of the image:

The image displays a "Recent saves" section, likely from a software application or game. It's formatted as a list of save points, each represented by a "Reload" button followed by information about the save.

Each save entry includes the date and time the save was made, as well as a "Score".

Here's a breakdown of the saves visible:

1.  "Reload" from 19/1/2025, 8:17:25 pm. Score: 1.25
2.  "Reload" from 19/1/2025, 8:01:54 pm. Score: 0.25
3.  "Reload" from 14/1/2025, 9:23:11 pm. Score: 0

The "Reload" buttons suggest the user can load the game or application state from these saved points.

Sha256sum is not recognized as an internal or external command how to solve
this plzz answer  
[@carlton](/u/carlton)

If you are on windows, you might not be able to use sha256sum.

Here are two disussions that might help you out.

  * [Discussion 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72087842/windows-equivalent-to-sha256sum-c-cryptographic-hash-digest-file-recursive)
  * [Discussion 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11746287/compare-filehash-in-powershell)



---

[@Rohitkumar7463](/u/rohitkumar7463) [@23f2003845](/u/23f2003845)

If you are on Windows Powershell  
Then instead of `sha256sum` you can simply use `Get-FileHash`

Send the output of the `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md` to a text file eg.
`output.txt` and then use `Get-FileHash` on powershell with the `output.txt`
and it will use sha256 by default and give you the exact same output.  
You might be able to pipe the data directly to `Get-FileHash` but I have not
tried direct piping. The above method works guaranteed.

Kind regards

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Sir

as you said in the previous post, the evaluation script is also updated based
on errors other students point out.

I am submitting my answers as soon as the GA is released and stopping once I
get 10/10.

Will you reevaluate the answers once the deadline is over? Or the marks I see
right now will be set in stone?

If you will, then it will be based on the updated evaluation script which can

I can solve this now using pandas.

From learning perspective, is this question aimed at making students to use
something like awk or is it fine if i can carry on with pandas?



![Here's a description of the image:

The image appears to be a listing of files, similar to what you might see in a terminal or command prompt. It has the following columns:

*   **Length:** Shows the file size (in what appears to be bytes).
*   **Date:** Indicates the last modification date.
*   **Time:** Shows the last modification time.
*   **Name:** Displays the filename.

There are four files listed, with data shown for each of those fields. The files are named `file0.txt`, `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt`. They have different lengths, dates, and times. The format is typical of a command-line listing.

[@23f2000573](/u/23f2000573) You can solve it with any tool you’re comfortable
with, including pandas.

But since you _already_ know how to do it with pandas, I suggest you explore
how to do it with something like `awk` (or any other tool) to get a broader
exposure into different approaches.

Sir is it right of sha sum question



![Here is a description of the image:

The image shows a Windows PowerShell window with various commands and their outputs. The user seems to be experimenting with file manipulation and hashing. 

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Initial Attempt to Change Directory:** The user first attempts to change the current directory to "downloads" and then attempts to change it to "Downloads", but encounters an error. The error message "Cannot find path 'C:\Users\HP\downloads\Downloads' because it does not exist" indicates that the directory "Downloads" (with a capital 'D') does not exist in the specified location.

*   **Using `npx` and `prettier`:** The user then executes the command `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md > output.txt`. This command uses `npx` to run the `prettier` package (version 3.4.2) on the file "README.md", and redirects the output to a new file named "output.txt".

*   **Calculating File Hash:** The user then uses the `Get-FileHash` cmdlet to calculate the SHA256 hash of the "output.txt" file. The output shows the algorithm used (SHA256), the calculated hash value (a long hexadecimal string), and the path to the file.

*   **Repeating Hash Calculation (Partially Visible):** The bottom of the image shows what appears to be another attempt to calculate the file hash, likely due to the user trying a different approach to confirm the result.

In essence, the image captures a user's PowerShell session involving navigating directories, using a code formatter, and generating file hashes.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/2/5/259fe82da0a001abf9302adbc16f3ceb4e1a1d1c_2_666x500.jpeg)

[@Rohitkumar7463](/u/rohitkumar7463) The hash code is exactly what you see
under the column Hash,

7E…E5

Thats the Hash code for the file output.txt

A Hash is a _nearly_ unique representation of some data within some range
dependent on the type of hashing algorithm and the amount of unique pieces of
data that need to be encoded. (just my colloquial definition of it, i am sure
you are able to ask GPT to give you a much better explanation)

**Time Zone Issues with the “List Files and Attributes” Question**

quick heads‐up about Question 15 (the one asking for files at least 8143
bytes, modified on or after Sun, 19 Nov 2006, 7:38 am GMT‑5). I’m physically
in a different time zone, but I eventually discovered the question seems to
expect you to be located in India and to interpret that files date/time
accordingly.  
I got the correct answer once i localized the files timestamp to IST.

Hi Arnav,

I tried your script on your dataset.  
Problem might be you are not executing `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in correct directory, you would need to execute it from `all_files` directory also there should not be any extra file other than that gets generated.

![Here's a breakdown of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a screenshot of a coding problem and what appears to be the execution of a script or command related to file attributes.

*   **Top Part:** A dark screen shows a terminal window (likely PowerShell). The output lists various `.txt` files with associated information (date, time, size in bytes, and file name). It seems like a directory listing. A count of 41 appears as well as minimum and maximum lengths.
*   **Bottom Part:** A webpage snippet shows a problem description:
    *   It mentions a file named "list file attributes.zip".
    *   It asks to extract the files and use the correct parameters to list all files in the folder along with their date and file size.
    *   It poses the question: "What's the total size of all files at least 1235 bytes large and modified on or after Wed, 6 Nov, 2019, 10:48 am IST?".
    *   A text input box with the value "507162" is present, accompanied by the text "Incorrect. Try again".
    *   A note saying that copying and pasting from the Windows Explorer is not advised, as this destroys timestamps. Rather, the instructions recommend using a utility such as 7zip for extracting the files and checking the timestamps.

**In essence:**

The user is trying to solve a coding challenge that involves listing files based on certain criteria (size and modification date) and calculating the total size of those files. The user's initial answer "507162" was incorrect, and the webpage provides hints on how to approach the problem.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/5/1/51e466de36ab81daac1abc2ff6f89471b3c5bf91_2_353x500.png)

Hi Saravanan,

I noticed an issue with your submission. In the question, there is a name
`Bob`, but it doesn’t appear in your answer after applying the required
sorting. Since the data for each student is dynamically generated and unique,
the answer you submitted seems inconsistent with your dataset.

We encourage collaboration among students, but copying answers is not
acceptable. Instead, I suggest reaching out to your friend to understand the
script they used, run it on your dataset, and ensure you fully grasp the
solution.

![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR and visual elements:

**Overall:**

The image shows a web form or application interface. It displays a "JSON Hash" section with what appears to be a large, potentially invalid, JSON-like string.  There is a "Hash" button, and below that, an error message indicating an issue with the provided JSON.

**Specific Elements:**

*   **Title:** "JSON Hash" is displayed prominently.
*   **JSON-like Data:** A large block of text is visible. It contains key-value pairs separated by colons, similar to JSON, but it contains many OCR errors and formatting issues. The beginning portion of the string is: "JUTAUNG: RSIVE ...".
*   **Button:** A green button labeled "Hash" suggests the user is intended to submit the JSON-like data to be processed in some way.
*   **Error Message:** A red-colored error message states: "Error: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 1 (line 1 column 2)". This clearly indicates that the system is unable to parse the data as valid JSON.

**Interpretation:**

The image suggests a user has entered or is attempting to generate a JSON hash, but the provided data is not in valid JSON format, leading to the error. The long string of characters likely comes from OCR errors.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/3/7/3738985d0d94f735a4c51462d37072bed8a7a1c9_2_690x274.png)

The answer is wrong but I have done every step correctly. Help



![Here's a description of the image, based on the OCR:

The image shows a task or instruction followed by a question, likely part of a coding challenge or tutorial. The initial instructions involve downloading a zip file, unzipping it into a folder, and then replacing all instances of "IITM" (case-insensitive) with "IIT Madras" within all files in that folder. The instruction also specifies that line endings should not be altered.

Following this, the question asks what the output of the bash command "cat * | sha256sum" would be when run inside the folder where the files were extracted and modified. An SHA256 hash is provided as a potential answer, but it is marked as "Incorrect. Try again.", suggesting that the user needs to re-evaluate their answer after performing the steps correctly.

Not sure how to resolve this error… any sugessions ?



![Here's a description of the image:

**Content Overview:**

The image shows a computer screen or document containing a coding/programming related task. It involves running a Python package and making an HTTP request.

**Top Section:**

*   There's an image at the top with the word "uv" prominently displayed, along with the text "package/project manager." A person is pointing at the display.

**Middle Section:**

*   The text describes running the "uv run --with httpie --https [URL]" command.
*   It states that this command installs the Python package "httpie" and makes an HTTPS request to the URL.
*   A specific HTTPS request is mentioned: sending a request to "https://httpbin.org/get" with the URL-encoded parameter "email" set to a specific email address.

**Bottom Section:**

*   The text poses a question: "What is the JSON output of the command? (Paste only the JSON body, not the headers)"
*   There's a field where it looks like an attempt to provide the JSON output has been made.
*   The text after this field states: "SyntaxError: Expected property name or '' in JSON at position 1 (line 1 column 2)" which suggests that the attempted JSON output is malformed or invalid.

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be part of a coding tutorial, exercise, or problem related to making HTTP requests and working with JSON data in Python. It includes an error message about a JSON syntax issue, indicating a need to correct the format of the JSON output.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/6/d64710c6f1d82d385c603313620a99ddcc9dfef0_2_690x300.jpeg)

But I have converted the file as it says in the question still i am getting
error that I am unable to understand. Can you just tell me please what
formatted answer should be that is just the type of answer it’s asking?

![The image shows a command-line interface (CLI) session, likely in Windows PowerShell, demonstrating the process of calculating SHA256 hashes of files.

First, the user navigates to the "downloads" directory using the `cd downloads` command.

Next, the `certutil -hashfile C:\Users\sarva\downloads\README.md SHA256` command is executed. This command calculates the SHA256 hash of the file "README.md" located in the "downloads" directory using the built-in Windows command-line utility "certutil." The output displays the calculated SHA256 hash, which is a long hexadecimal string.  The command is noted to have completed successfully.

Then, the command `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md > output.txt` is executed. This command uses `npx` to run the `prettier` formatting tool (version 3.4.2) on the `README.md` file, and redirects the formatted output to a new file named `output.txt`.  The `-y` option is likely used to automatically confirm any prompts that `npx` might present.

Finally, `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 output.txt` is executed.  This is a PowerShell command that calculates the SHA256 hash of the file `output.txt`.  The output is presented in a tabular format, displaying the algorithm used (SHA256), the resulting hash value, and the path to the file. The path is abbreviated as `C:\Users\sarva\downloads\outp...`

![Here is a description of the image:

The image shows a terminal window with a command and its output. The user's prompt, "sarva@SURIYA MINGW64 ~/downloads," indicates the current directory is within the "downloads" folder. The command being executed is `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum`.

This command uses `npx` to execute the `prettier` package (version 3.4.2) on the file "README.md". The `-y` flag likely auto-confirms any prompts. The output of the `prettier` command is then piped (`|`) to the `sha256sum` command, which calculates the SHA256 hash of the formatted "README.md" file.

The output shown below the command is the SHA256 checksum.

![Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a snippet from a coding challenge or tutorial related to SQL. It describes a SQLite database table named "tickets" that contains customer bids for concert tickets. The table has columns: "type", "units", and "price". The image provides some sample data rows for the table (Silver, gold, BRONZE as types).

The challenge is to write an SQL query to calculate the total sales of all items with the ticket type "Gold," ignoring case and potential misspellings.

The user has attempted to write the query:

```sql
select sum(units*price)
from tickets
where type='gold' collate nocase;
```

The image also shows an error message: "Error: Got [[124944.59]]..." which suggests that the output that the system is expecting might be different from the current query results.

Finally, there's a hint provided: "Get all rows where the Type is "Gold". Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as "Gold". Calculate the sales as Units * Price, and sum them up." This re-emphasizes the requirements of the task.

![The image is a question from an online assessment or exercise, specifically asking about converting a text file into a JSON object using multi-cursor editing and then hashing the resulting JSON.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Task:** The task is to convert a text file (named "q-multi-cursor-json.txt") into a JSON object using multi-cursor editing. The instructions emphasize converting key-value pairs into the standard JSON format: `{key: value, key: value, ...}`.

*   **Hashing:** The next step is to take the resulting JSON object and paste it into a tool available at "tools-in-data-science.pages.dev/jsonhash". After pasting the JSON, the user is instructed to click the "Hash" button.

*   **Answer:** The image shows a text input box where the user has provided an answer ("c0b9426a7f358720f193d3806497ec0d81d10d835085d0f284f804bf3a6a1536").

*   **Feedback:** The assessment system has marked the answer as "Incorrect. Try again."

In essence, the image captures a specific step in a data science task involving JSON manipulation and hashing, with feedback indicating that the user's current solution is not correct.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/e/6/e60748f8290e5bf6a7fedca9e4555355e48947f6_2_690x133.png)

Check the structure of your json object. It should be {key1: value1, key2:
value2}. Also make sure you enclose the keys and values in double-quotes, and
after every key-value pair put a comma.



---

i am doing so only … i can send u the example -  
{ “0”: “wEfsmtde”,  
“83”: “NghqzO3DL”,  
“NqN7EcM”: “I”,  
“vFD2C”: “KAB”}  
i am not able to find what’s the mistake



---

Your format seems to be correct, but cause you are still facing that problem
then these are the few reasons I can think of

  1. Check the entire JSON object and make sure that each and every element follows this format.
  2. Use Chrome for getting that hash code, it could be the case that some other browser may not be pasting the object as intended.



---

Okay, i will go through my json object once.  
And for hash code i am using chrome only



---

It worked.  
Thank you
