![Here's a description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be an online learning platform or course management system. It has a sidebar navigation menu on the left and the main content area on the right.

**Left Sidebar:**

*   Contains a logo and the text "IIT Madras" and "Jan 2025-TDS" at the top.
*   The menu items include: "Modules" (with an icon of stacked documents) and "Grades" (with an "A" inside a square).
*   Under "Modules," the course structure is visible:
    *   "Course Introduction"
    *   "Module 1: Development Tools" (expanded)
    *   "Graded Assignment 1" (highlighted as selected)
    *   "Module 2: Deployment Tools"

**Main Content Area:**

*   The heading is "Graded Assignment 1."
*   Beneath the title, important information is presented:
    *   "Due date for this assignment: 2025-01-26, 23:59 IST."
    *   A note stating that you can submit multiple times before the due date, but the final submission will be considered.
*   A troubleshooting section lists common causes for difficulty accessing the assignment:
    1.  Ad blockers
    2.  Cookie settings
    3.  JavaScript requirement
    4.  Recommended browser (Chrome)
    5.  Browser extensions
    6.  Anti-virus software
*   A reminder in bold to use the student ID in the specified format (e.g., 22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) for the graded assignment evaluation.
*   A question is posed: "I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it."
*   There are two radio button options: "Yes" and "No".

**Overall Impression:**

The screenshot depicts a typical interface for accessing and completing a graded assignment within an online course. It provides instructions, a deadline, troubleshooting tips, and a confirmation question. The platform appears to be associated with IIT Madras.

Likewise the GAs also are available through the links in the seek portal as
well as on the course domain shared above.

The course introduction has very important information. Many students who
faced problems in Tools for Data Science in previous terms usually never read
the intro. Please be diligent to read _everything carefully._

Don’t gloss over these bits (they are expandable if you click on them) for eg…

![Here's a description of the image:

The image is a dark gray rectangle that appears to be a slide or a section from a presentation. Within the rectangle are four bullet points, each starting with a gray triangle bullet point. The text for each point is white and reads:

1. "This course exposes you to real-life tools"
2. "This course is quite hard"
3. "Programming skills are a pre-requisite"
4. "We encourage learning by sharing"

The layout suggests that these are key points or information being conveyed about a course.

![Here's a description of the image:

**Content:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a course description or review page.  It provides information about the course's difficulty level and includes student feedback. The text "This course exposes you to real-life tools" is at the top of the frame.

**Key elements include:**

*   **Course Difficulty:** It is stated "This course is quite hard".
*   **Student Feedback:** A list of bullet points highlights student feedback, mentioning that the course used to be easier, now covers more, requires extra time, has unpredictable grading, and that a particular element of the course ("The ROE") is difficult.
*   **Prerequisites:** A good understanding of various programming languages, data concepts, and general programming skills are a pre-requisite.
*   **Recommendation:**  The text "Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you're ready for this course. Please drop this course in a later term if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now." suggests assessing readiness before fully committing to the course.
*   **Community:** The last statement states that they encourage learning by sharing

**Overall Impression:** The image conveys that the course is challenging and requires preparation. It also provides guidance to potential students on how to evaluate their readiness for the course.
