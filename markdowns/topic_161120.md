The image shows a question presented in a dark-themed interface. The question asks: "What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/".  Below the question is a text box, indicating a space to provide an answer. Underneath the text box, there's an error message. The error message states that an email address "22f3001315@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" is not found within the HTML response that follows. The HTML response includes a DOCTYPE declaration, html tags, head tags (with metadata for charset and viewport), a title ("Dolphin Facts"), and some basic CSS styling for the body (font-family, background-color, text color, and text alignment). The error message implies that the system expected to find the email address in the page content or HTML, but it was not present.

Hi Guddu,

Can you share your GitHub repo. For GitHub pages question.

Check your browser console most probably CORS is causing problem.

Try adding CORS to your code it might work.

Kind regards

![Here's a description of the image, focusing on the code and terminal outputs:

**Overall Layout:**

The image is a screenshot of a macOS desktop. There are two main windows:

1.  **Text Editor (main.py):**  Occupies the left side of the screen.  It contains Python code using the FastAPI framework.

2.  **Terminal:** On the right side, showing the output of running the Python code using `uvicorn`. There's also a browser window at the bottom right.

**Code in the Text Editor:**

*   **Imports:** The code starts with necessary imports: `fastapi`, `Query`, `CORSMiddleware`, `List`, `Optional`, and `csv`.
*   **App Initialization:** `app = FastAPI()` creates a FastAPI application instance.
*   **CORS Configuration:**  CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is configured to allow requests from any origin (`allow_origins=["*"]`). Other CORS settings include `allow_credentials`, `allow_methods`, and `allow_headers`.
*   **Data Loading from CSV:**
    *   The code opens a CSV file named `q-fastapi.csv` located in the user's Downloads directory.
    *   It reads the CSV file using `csv.DictReader`, which reads each row as a dictionary.
    *   It iterates through the rows and appends dictionaries containing "studentId" (converted to integer) and "class" to a `students` list.
*   **API Endpoint (/api):**
    *   The `@app.get("/api")` decorator defines an API endpoint at `/api`.
    *   The `get_students` function handles requests to this endpoint.
    *   It accepts an optional query parameter `class_` of type `List[str]`.
    *   If `class_` is provided, it filters the `students` list to include only students whose "class" matches the provided `class_` value.
    *   Debugging print statements are included to show the requested classes and filtered students.
    *   The function returns a dictionary containing the (filtered) `students` list.
*   **Uvicorn Startup:**
    *   The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures the following code runs only when the script is executed directly.
    *   `uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0..1", port=8000)` starts the Uvicorn server, making the FastAPI application accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

**Terminal Output:**

*   **Uvicorn Startup Messages:**  The terminal shows the typical Uvicorn startup messages, indicating:
    *   Uvicorn is running and watching for changes in the specified directory.
    *   The server is accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
    *   The reloader process and server process are started.
    *   Application startup is complete.
*   **API Requests and Responses:**
    *  There's an OPTIONS request related to CORS, likely for preflight checks
    *   A request to `/api` without parameters is made.
    *   A request to `/api?class=A` is made and returns a 200 OK.

**Browser Window (Bottom Right):**

The browser appears to be a testing tool, possibly for API calls, with a field to "upload" something.

**In summary:** The image shows a developer working on a FastAPI application. The code defines an API endpoint that returns student data, optionally filtered by class. The terminal output shows the server starting and handling requests.

![The image shows an error message from ngrok, a tool that creates secure tunnels to localhost servers. The error, labeled "ERR_NGROK_8012," indicates that while traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, the agent failed to establish a connection to the upstream web service running at http://localhost:8080. The specific error encountered was "dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused," suggesting that the web service on the local machine is either not running or is not accessible on the specified port.

The image provides guidance for developers, advising them to ensure that a web service is running on http://localhost:8080 and to test the connection using cURL or a browser. It also includes a link to ngrok's documentation for further assistance.

For visitors of the page experiencing the error, the image suggests waiting a few minutes and refreshing the page. If the issue persists, it advises contacting the developer of the page for more information.

Visually, the image presents a step-by-step diagram indicating the flow of traffic from the internet through the ngrok Edge and ngrok Agent, ultimately failing to connect to the local service. Each stage is represented by an icon, with a green checkmark indicating success and a red "X" marking the point of failure.

Hi Mishkat,

Please use triple backticks to encapsulate code, so that we can debug your
code more easily.

eg

    
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
       print ("Hello")
    

Please use this discourse etiquette to share code.

Thanks and kind regards

Hi Mishkat,

This error is because you are filtering on `class_` instead of `class`

So if you send a request on `http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S` you will see
response for that `1S` class only.

kind regards



---

thank you so much after modifying the code it got accepted



---

Hi Guddu,

Inside `index.html` file of your repo, don’t put html code just put your email
in the file nothing else.

This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email
that’s on page.

kind regards.

Hi Telvin,

Try opening `localhost:8080` in browser if that works, if it opens in browser
then issue might be with some network configurations.

I solved this question in github codespace, which didn’t require me to make
any changes in network.

[@Nelson](/u/nelson) I would recommend [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker
CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) rather than [Docker
Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Docker Desktop is [not free for organizations over 250
people](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/desktop-license/) and many
organizations have therefore moved away from it.

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) I tired ,
in browser localhost:8080 is working fine but ngrok is not working. Is there
any other tools for tunneling that can be used.



---

[@22f2001640](/u/22f2001640) in that case

  * a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or
  * a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080

Please try one of these:

  * Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network
  * GitHub codespaces, as [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) suggested

You _could_ try an ngrok alternative like
[localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) but I don’t think that’ll
work.

Thank you, Sir!

> What is the Docker image URL? It should look like:

If I use Podman, will the answer be correct assuming I have done all steps
correctly?

![Here's a description of the image, focusing on the context and elements related to debugging a web application:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a developer's workspace, likely in the process of debugging a web application. The screen is split between several key components:

*   A web browser with a query to a student data API
*   A terminal window showing server logs.
*   A web page displaying requirements for the task.

**Key Elements and Their Interpretation:**

1.  **Browser Window (Top Left):**
    *   Address bar:  `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class_=15` This indicates the developer is making a request to a local web server, specifically to an API endpoint `/api`. It's querying for student data based on the class. The underscore in `class_` may indicate some coding convention.
    *   "Pretty print" output: The output shows the JSON response from the API, which should contain a list of students belonging to the class "15".

2.  **Terminal Window (Bottom Left):**
    *   Server logs: The logs display the HTTP requests being made to the server and their status codes (200 OK, indicating successful requests).
    *   Log entries:  The entries provide useful information, such as the specific API endpoints being accessed (e.g., `/api?class_=15&class=2A`), HTTP methods used (GET, OPTIONS), and timestamps. They also show that the developer is testing the API with different class combinations.

3.  **Browser Window (Right):**
    *   Project instructions: This page is crucial.
        *   API Endpoint:  It clearly states the expected API endpoint format: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.
        *   Query Parameters:  It explains that the `class` query parameter should be used to filter students by class.
        *   CORS:  It reminds the developer to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), which is necessary for the browser to make requests to the local server.
        *   Error Message: A JSON error message with a long list of `"studentid"` and `"class"` pairs which suggests an error in the API's response.

**Inference about the Debugging Process:**

Based on the elements, the developer is likely:

*   Trying to retrieve student data from a FastAPI API endpoint using the `class` query parameter.
*   Examining server logs to understand what requests are being made and if there are any server-side errors.
*   Reviewing the API definition and project instructions to ensure the requests are being made correctly and to understand the expected format of the API response.
*   Trying to fix an error related to the API's response.

**Overall Problem**
It appears the response from the API is not what is expected. The error displayed in the error response suggests that the data may not be being filtered correctly or is not being formatted as it should be.

Hi Mishkat,

The GA url encoded parameter is `class`  
In your screenshot, you are using `class_`  
Your code that we examined earlier also accepts `class_` as the parameter
instead of `class` as required by the GA  
The GA will test your deployment by sending it a request with the url encoded
parameter `class`

![Here is a description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of a web browser displaying an error message from ngrok. The error message, labeled "ERR_NGROK_8012," indicates that ngrok successfully tunneled traffic to the ngrok agent, but the agent failed to establish a connection to the upstream web service at `http://localhost:5000`. The specific error encountered was "dial tcp [::1]:5000: connect: connection refused."

The page provides suggestions for both the developer and the visitor of the page. For developers, it advises ensuring that a web service is running on `http://localhost:5000` and trying to access it via cURL or a browser. For visitors, it suggests waiting a few minutes and refreshing the page or contacting the developer.

At the top of the page, there's a status diagram showing the connection flow: "Internet" -> "ngrok Edge" -> "ngrok Agent" -> "Your Service." The "Your Service" step is marked with a red "X," indicating the point of failure.

The URL in the browser's address bar is `9eab-2402-e280-3e1e-193-508b-9d2e-a63e-931c.ngrok-free.app`, suggesting that this is a free ngrok tunnel. At the bottom of the page it is labelled "Powered by ngrok".

Hi Mishkat,

In your code, the word `class` is a reserved keyword in python. So simply
changing `class_` to `class` is not going to work. The _only_ thing you need
to change is the keyword accepted by the api _not_ the variable name used
inside your function. Hope that helps you narrow down the problem.

Kind regards

Hi Team ,

For GA - 2 , Question 6:  
I am done with the code, deployed same on vercel.  
And It is working fine gives correct json response as expected in browser.

But When I try to that on portal It gives me “CORS Missing Allow Origin”
Error.

I have added “Access-Control-Allow-Origin” as “*” for allowing request from
any origin.

I get the correct response in browser but it fails in quiz portal.  
Can anyone please suggest what exactly I am missing here.

Thanks

![Here's a description of the image, breaking it down for clarity:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a screenshot of a web browser, likely in the context of a programming or development task. It appears to be a problem or assignment related to creating a Python API hosted on Vercel. The user seems to be troubleshooting an error.

**Elements Present:**

1.  **Problem Statement:**
    *   A description of the task is at the top, including downloading a `vercel-python.json` file and deploying a Python application to Vercel.
    *   The goal is to create an API that takes two names (X and Y) as input and returns their marks as a JSON response.
    *   An example JSON output is provided: `{"marks": 10, 20}`.
    *   There's a question asking for the correct Vercel URL.

2.  **URL Attempt and Error:**
    *   A field shows the user's attempted Vercel URL: `https://vercel...hagra-barodekars-projects.vercel.app/api` (parts are blurred).
    *   Below the URL is an error message: `TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource.` This indicates that the browser is unable to connect to the specified URL.

3.  **Browser's Developer Tools (Network Tab):**
    *   The bottom portion of the image shows the "Network" tab of the browser's developer tools. This tab is used to monitor network requests and responses.
    *   There are several requests listed, including GET and POST requests.  Some names are blurred.
    *   The important request is a "GET" to URL shown in the problem question. The status of 200 indicates a successful response. However, there is an warning indicated that the request is blocked because of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

**Interpretation and Potential Issues:**

*   **Network Error:** The `NetworkError` suggests a basic connectivity issue. This could be due to incorrect URL, server being down, or network problems on the user's end.

*   **CORS Error** CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one which served the web page. This error is common when trying to call an API hosted on a different domain from a web application in a browser. The Vercel API needs to be configured to allow requests from the origin of where the code is running.

In summary, the image captures a debugging session where a user is trying to deploy and access a Python API on Vercel, but encountering a network error, a CORS error while attempting to access it through the browser's network tab.

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) ,  
Can you please help on this one.



---

Hi Kushagra,

can you share vercel url so that I can test.

Kind regards



---

Hi Aindree,

I tried to send a request to your application `https://your-
app2.vercel.app/api` with url encoded parameter `class=7Q`. It should fetch
marks of that particular class. But in response it sends `{"marks": []}`.

Check if your csv file is correct. Also check if code is correct.

Kind regards  
Jivraj

For the questions such as cors, llm i have to locally run the code and submit
it.After a while if i have to submit it again the prev url that i have
submitted is throwing an error. Maybe becaue it is checking the url again at
the time of submission. Fix this issue, the similar issue lies with the image
compression problem. when i upload the code and checks and submits it at that
time i got the marks but after sometime if i make the change in some other
question the file that i uploaded prev is nowhere to found.so please fix this
issue  
[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)

Hi Tushar,

For questions which require submitting a url, when you click on save button
all those server’s should be running.

For that image uploading question one solution would be to keep image in a
particular directory, and then upload from there every time you make a
submission.

Kind regards  
Jivraj

For the Q.2 on image compression, for PNG, SVG or WEBP files, I’m getting the
error “Could not process image. Is it browser supported image? Image pixels do
not match the original” (I believe the last part is not applicable as the
image was not processed ). Visually, I could not find any difference between
the two files and the size of new file is less than 1,500 bytes.

Tried through Chrome v132.0.6834.83 without any add-ons/extensions.

![Here's a description of the image based on the text and visual elements:

The image is a screenshot of a coding challenge or problem description, likely related to deploying a Python application to Vercel.

**Here's a breakdown of the content:**

*   **Problem Statement:**
    *   The user is instructed to download a `q-vercel-python.json` file, which contains marks (scores) for 100 imaginary students.
    *   The task is to create and deploy a Python app to Vercel, exposing an API.
    *   The API should accept a request with two names (e.g., `?name=X&name=Y`) and return a JSON response with the marks corresponding to those names.
    *   An example JSON response format is provided: `{"marks": [10, 20]}`.

*   **Vercel URL Input:**
    *   The user is prompted to provide the Vercel URL for their deployed app.
    *   An example of the expected URL format is given: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`.

[@23f2003751](/u/23f2003751)  
While I understand why you might choose to use `flask` due to your familiarity
with it,  
the `http.server` library is just very simple to use.

The **only extra line of code** you would need inside your `get` request if
you used the `http.server` library would be:

`self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")`

Try to rewrite your code using `http.server` library so that your debugging
for simple tasks like this is easy.

The boilerplate code for a `get` request using the `http.server` library was
already given in Q6. So you have to do very minimal modifications to it and it
works like a charm.

Kind regards

then do the final submission from my my device then again the answers are not
getting submitted for the same three questions.

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Sir please help me through this



---

[@23F300327](/u/23f300327) You would have to be a bit more specific on what
exactly is the nature of your error on your machine.

GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an
online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a
macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has
no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems.

Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the
use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access
the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request
triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather
than you directly.

Also the live sessions on
[youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_h5u1jMeBCl1BquBhgunA4t08XAxsA-C&si=NE4LEQe48XfzAYbc)
will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing.

There will be session 2025-01-20T14:30:00Z→2025-01-20T16:30:00Z which will be
recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and
libraries.

![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR and visual elements:

**Overall:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web browser window. The browser has a dark theme.

**Content:**

*   The visible tab titles suggest the user is working on a project involving FastAPI and Vercel.
*   The URL in the address bar is: `https://vercel-fastapi-aa0kdktjz-mishkat02s-projects.vercel.app/api?name=IE&name=G6k` This indicates that the user is interacting with an API endpoint hosted on Vercel.
*   The main content of the page is a JSON-like output: `{"marks": [58,53]}`.  It looks like a response from an API, where "marks" is a key and it has a list of numeric values (58 and 53).
* There are browser tabs for Project 1, TDS 2025, GA2-Depi, how to inst, no subject, ChatGPT, and multiple tabs labeled vercel-fast.

**Interpretation:**

The user seems to be developing or testing a FastAPI application deployed on Vercel, and the screenshot shows the JSON response returned by the API, likely containing an array of numerical values associated with a field called "marks."

[@23F300327](/u/23f300327)

Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the
applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and
run a local http server as you are doing in your code.

When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api  
with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles
the get request.

The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict
between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded
in your program.

That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API
service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this

    
    
    # api/index.py
    import json
    from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler
    
    class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
        def do_GET(self):
            self.send_response(200)
            self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')
            self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
            self.end_headers()
            self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"message": "Hello!"}).encode('utf-8'))
            return
    

Notice there is no `if __name__ == "__main__":` code block.  
This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your
module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend
server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it
runs your application.

`if __name__ == "__main__":` is used to execute some code **only** if the file
was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting
point of the application.

Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default
`handler` class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working
prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared.

Another possible problem:  
By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode)
into the \u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is
expecting a serialised UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same
on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding
problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues
[TDS > Development Tools > unicode](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/unicode)

So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it.

Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other.

Kind regards

![The image displays instructions on how to use Llamafile and Ngrok, followed by an error message related to a website.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Instructions:** The top of the image shows instructions for downloading Llamafile, running a specific Llama-3 model with it, and creating a tunnel to the Llamafile server using Ngrok. It also provides an example of what an Ngrok URL might look like.
*   **Ngrok URL:** Below the instructions, the actual Ngrok URL being used is displayed as: `https://58e1-150-107-42-211.ngrok-free.app`.
*   **Error Message:** The major portion of the image is an error message. The message "Error: Response is not valid JSON" indicates an issue with data being returned in a JSON format. This is followed by a large chunk of HTML code, suggesting the web server encountered a problem while trying to generate the page. The HTML code includes references to "cloudflare" "exam.sanand.workers.dev" and "worker threw exception". The message also includes a Cloudflare Ray ID. and information on how to log into cloudflare and check the error logs for the exam.sanand website.

In essence, the image shows an attempt to use Llamafile and Ngrok, but encountering an error on the website `exam.sanand.workers.dev`, which is likely hosted behind Cloudflare. The error suggests a problem with the JSON data format or issues with a worker exception.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/e/8/e8d8f3d2ee80c2a0b39285d06405bcd0ccc8f338_2_690x343.jpeg)

Hi Mishkat,

![Here's a description of the image you sent:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a deployment dashboard, likely from a platform like Vercel. It shows information related to a specific deployment, its domains, status, source code, and also indicates a "404 Not Found" error.

**Key Elements and Details:**

*   **Left Panel:** Displays a white screen with a "404 Not Found" error message. It includes the error code "Not Found" and an ID. A link to "Read our documentation to learn more about this error" is also visible.

*   **Right Panel:** Contains deployment details:
    *   **Deployment:** Shows a unique URL identifier: `tds21jan-ghtj3xr7w-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app`
    *   **Domains:** Lists the domain name associated with the deployment, including `tds21jan.vercel.app` and `tds21jan-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app`.
    *   **Status:** Indicates the deployment status as "Ready" (with a green dot).
    *   **Created:** Shows when the deployment was created ("18h ago by jivraj-18").
    *   **Source:** Includes links to view the code (`<> View code`) and shows the command used for deployment (`> vercel deploy`).

*   **Bottom Panel:** Encourages the user to connect their project with a Git repository for a production deployment. A button labeled "Connect Git repo" is present.

**Color Palette:**

The interface has a dark theme (primarily black and dark gray) with some white and light-colored text. The "Ready" status uses a green color.

**Interpretation:**

The image suggests a deployment process that may have completed successfully, but the deployed application is returning a "404 Not Found" error. The user is prompted to connect their project to a Git repository, likely for better deployment management and collaboration.

Hi NamanBeri,

Just remove `.git` it will work.



---

[UPDATE 22/02/2025]: GA 2 NEW DEADLINE: 2025-02-02T18:29:00Z



---

I’m not sure of the exact reason for the issue, but there are different ways
to deploy to Vercel. One approach is using a `vercel.json` configuration file,
and another is adding headers directly in the API code.

You can follow [Gui Bibeau’s guide](https://www.frontend-
devops.com/blog/python-on-vercel) to add CORS headers to your deployment
setup. Also check the recording from yesterday’s session for more clarity in
that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If
you’re still facing issues, you can join today’s session at 9 PM.

For deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to [this guide on DEV
Community](https://dev.to/andrewbaisden/how-to-deploy-a-python-flask-app-to-
vercel-2o5k). I’ve tried both methods, and they work well.



---

Okay, I’ll try to it again using these methods and let you know  
Thank you

**Overall Image:**

The image shows a computer screen capture of what appears to be an online quiz or learning platform. It's divided into two main sections: the quiz interface and some debugging/developer information.

**Quiz Interface (Top Portion):**

*   **Title:** Likely the title of the quiz or course.
*   **Score:** Shows a score of 5.5 out of 10.
*   **Controls:** There are "Check" and "Save" buttons.
*   **Instructions:** A list of instructions for the quiz-taker. Key points:
    *   The user is encouraged to use provided materials, but it's OK to skip ahead.
    *   "Check" to see right/wrong answers.
    *   "Save" regularly, multiple saves are allowed.
    *   Reloading the page is OK.
    *   Browser might struggle.
    *   Allowed to use any resources.
    *   The quiz is hackable.
*   **Discussion/Help:** A button to join a discussion on Discourse (a forum platform).
*   **Login Information:** The user is logged in with an ID of "23F1001348@ds.study.iitm.ac.in".
*   **Recent Saves:** A log of recent saves, including the dates, times, and scores.

**Developer Information (Bottom Portion):**

*   **Download Instructions:** Shows instructions to download "Llama2.c.LLaMAplus" model with K.
*   **API Information:** Shows information on how to create a tunnel to the LLamafile server using ngrok.
*   **URL:** https://103.76.82.164.ngrok-free.app
*   **JSON Response:** A long snippet of JSON code, probably the response from an API call. The JSON contains information about the squares/fields.

**In summary, the image is a screenshot of a quiz interface with a debugging console, possibly to assist the user in determining correct quiz answers.**

From image that you have shared, it explains ngrok tunnel that you are
submitting in answer is not running.

For any assignment if it involves running some server then you would need to
keep all the server’s running when you submit

**Content:**

The image is a screenshot of a web browser window. It appears to be a test or assignment interface. The active tab in the browser has the address `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga2`.

The content of the page includes:
*   A due date: "Due Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST"
*   A score: "Score: 5.5 / 10"
*   Buttons: "Check" and "Save"
*   Instructions:
    *   Download Llamafile, and run it with Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.06 K.llamafile model.
    *   Create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok.
*   A question: "What is the ngrok URL? It might look like: https://[random].ngrok-free.app/"
*   An input field where the user has entered a URL: `https://b1ae-117-198-90-156.ngrok-free.app`
*   An error message: "Error: Response is not valid JSON: <!DOCTYPE HTML> ... 501 - Server does not support this operation."

**Error Message Analysis:**

The error message indicates that the server at the entered ngrok URL is responding with HTML instead of JSON. Specifically, it's an "Error 501: Unsupported method ('POST')" which suggests that the server is not configured to handle POST requests made to that URL.

**Overall Impression:**

The user is likely attempting to connect to a Llamafile server through an ngrok tunnel and is encountering a server configuration error. The server does not support the HTTP POST method being used by the application, or the server does not support JSON format.

encountering the same error no matter which port i use [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)



![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR output:

The image is a screenshot of an error page from ngrok, a service that creates secure tunnels to expose local servers to the internet.

**Error Description:**

*   **Error Code:** ERR\_NGROK\_8012
*   The message indicates that traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent. However, the agent couldn't establish a connection to the upstream web service.
*   The service is identified as being located at `undefined://localhost:52525`. This "undefined" part is a significant clue about the problem.
*   The specific error encountered was: `dial tcp [::1]:52525: connect: connection refused`

**Page Layout:**

*   A progress indicator showing "Internet," "ngrok Edge," "ngrok Agent," and "Your Service." The "Your Service" stage is marked with an error (red "X").
*   An error message box.
*   Instructions for developers, suggesting they ensure a web service is running at the specified address.
*   Instructions for visitors, recommending they wait and refresh the page or contact the developer.

**Interpretation:**

The core issue is that ngrok cannot connect to the local web server it's supposed to be forwarding traffic to. The "undefined" in the address `undefined://localhost:52525` suggests there's a configuration problem with how the upstream web service's address is being specified. The "connection refused" error indicates that nothing is listening on port 52525 on localhost, or that a firewall is blocking the connection.

Hi Naman,

error code 524 is generally because of timeout in response, one thing you can
check is if there is load on Llama server as information that I got by a
google search [Error 524: A Timeout Occurred (What It Is & How to Fix
It)](https://www.lifewire.com/error-524-a-timeout-occurred-4782741). I tried
submitting now while replying at 2:45 am it was working fine.

I have checked both the expected result from the assignment and result from

[@carlton](/u/carlton) can you clarify where went wrong



![The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be a coding or software development environment, likely a web browser or IDE. The context is related to a FastAPI API endpoint that should return students based on a class query parameter.

Here's a breakdown of the image:

*   **Top portion:** Instructions about how the API should function. Specifically, it should return only students that are in the classes specified in the query parameters. The order of the returned students should match the order they appear in the CSV file. It also mentions enabling CORS.
*   **Middle portion:** An attempted API call to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.
*   **Error message:** "Error: Response undefined does not match expected...". This indicates that the actual response from the API call did not match the expected data, which is a JSON array containing student IDs and classes. The expected data is a very long array of objects, looking like `[["studentid":67,"class":"6X"],["studentid":86,"class":"ST"], ...]`. The error implies that the response from the API was either empty or had a different structure than the expected JSON array.
*   **Bottom portion:** Indication of automated testing and an intention to add the `?class=` query to the URL to verify if the response matches the data.
*   **Lower right corner:** Date and Time: "06:54 24-01-2025."

In essence, the image shows a scenario where an API call is being tested, and the test is failing due to an unexpected response from the API.

![Here's a description of the image:

**Content:**

The image is a screenshot of a web browser displaying data in a JSON-like format. The data appears to be a list of student IDs and their corresponding class.

**URL:**

The URL in the address bar is `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=6X&class=5T&class=78&class-22`. This suggests a local server running on port 8000, serving an API endpoint that returns student data based on class. The parameters in the URL (`class=6X`, `class=5T`, etc.) indicate that the API is filtering results based on class names.

**Data Format:**

The displayed data is structured as a JSON array. Each element in the array is a JSON object containing two key-value pairs:
*   `studentId`: An integer representing the ID of the student.
*   `class`: A string representing the class of the student (e.g., "6X", "5T", "78", "22").

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows the output of an API call that retrieves student data for different classes. The data is displayed in a raw JSON format, likely as a result of directly accessing the API endpoint in the browser. The 'Pretty-print' suggests the data may have been formatted for readability.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/3/2/3275c782991af68b7160960aa59b153c8e3ee947.png)

![Here's a description of the image based on the OCR text and visual cues:

**Content:**

The image appears to be a screenshot from a tutorial or documentation page related to GitHub Actions. It provides instructions on how to set up and trigger a GitHub Action, specifically focusing on ensuring that one of the steps within the action has a name that includes a specific email address (23f3001255@ds.study.iitm.ac.in).

**Key Elements:**

*   **Code Snippet:** The central part of the image displays a code snippet in YAML format, which likely represents the structure of a GitHub Action workflow file. It includes "jobs," "test," and "steps." A specific step is shown with the name containing the mentioned email address and a command to print "Hello, world!"

*   **Instructional Text:** Text above the code snippet provides context and instructions: "Create a GitHub action on one of your GitHub repositories. Make sure one of the steps in the action has a name that contains your email address [email address]. For example:"

*   **Repository URL:** The image asks "What is your repository URL?" and displays an example URL format: "https://github.com/USER/REPO" with a red box, including the user's URL as: "https://github.com/divya23f3001255/divya.github.io"

*   **Error Message:** Below the URL, there's a red error message: "Error: No step matches 23f3001255@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"

**Overall Impression:**

The image is likely part of a troubleshooting guide or assignment where the user needs to configure a GitHub Action with a specific step name containing their email address. The error message indicates that the provided configuration is not being correctly interpreted or matched by the system.

**Content Overview:**

The image seems to be a screenshot of a coding challenge or a task description, likely related to creating an API using FastAPI. It outlines the requirements for an API endpoint that filters student data based on class names provided as query parameters. It asks what the API URL endpoint for FastAPI is. The last line indicates that the user is expected to input an API URL endpoint. However, it seems like the submission failed with a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error.

**Key elements:**

*   **Textual Instructions:** The image contains instructions describing how the API should behave. It explains how to filter students by class using the `class` query parameter. It also emphasizes the importance of CORS to allow GET requests from any origin.
*   **Example API URL:** The prompt provides an example of a typical FastAPI API URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`
*   **Input Field:** There's an input field (indicated by a red border and an error icon) where the user has likely attempted to enter the API URL. The contents of the field are blurred.
*   **Error Message:** The error message "TypeError: Failed to fetch" suggests that the entered URL may be incorrect, the server isn't running or reachable, there is some issue with network connectivity or that CORS is not set up properly.

[@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382)

Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it.
Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant.
There is more than one way to skin a cat.

That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a
single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no
time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way
does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its
fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running
server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the
“spirit of your question”.

Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding
of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost
apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire
courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the
basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials
to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then
students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic
essentials!

So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle
their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured
understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their
weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to
get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the
guy/gal who just gets it done.

In the meanwhile:

There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the
most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by
using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be
made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are
software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break,
understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find
the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a
routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when
in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying
architecture that glues everything.

Kind regards

To the right of the text, there's a red brick wall oriented diagonally. The word "FIREWALL" is written vertically down the side of the wall.

Below the text and to the left is a silhouette of a person wearing a hat, facing away from the viewer. The person's face is not visible. On the back of the person, the word "HACKER" is written in red, slightly curved.

In front of the hacker silhouette is a laptop with a blue screen and white code displayed. Between the laptop and the brick wall are three orange skull and crossbones symbols, implying a threat or danger.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/e/be3a9cfa13491650ab7a84c59b74fe3a050a30ee.jpeg)


![Here's a description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a vibrant and visually engaging graphic comparing Virtual Machines (VMs) and Containers in a computing context. It employs a mix of stylized illustrations and text to highlight the comparison.

**Elements and Layout:**

*   **Title Text:** The prominent text "VMs VS CONTAINERS" is centrally positioned, using a large, bold sans-serif font in white with a shadow, making it immediately eye-catching. "ANIMATED" is at the bottom.

*   **Virtual Machines (VMs) Illustration:** On the left side, there are several stacks of simulated server instances, likely representing VMs. These are depicted as complex systems with labels like "Email," "Webserver," and "Database," suggesting a multi-layered architecture for each VM.

*   **Containers Illustration:** The right side features a depiction of a container infrastructure, visualized as a large server rack. Inside the rack, there are graphical representations of containers, simply labeled "Application," highlighting the focus on individual application deployment.

*   **Color Palette:** The image uses a gradient background that transitions from blue at the top to green at the bottom. The VM instances are predominantly green, while the containers are also green.

*   **Decorative Elements:** The container server features colorful lights at the top and green lights for each containers section.

**Purpose and Tone:**

The graphic likely aims to explain or compare the concepts of VMs and Containers in a simplified and visually appealing manner. The use of bright colors and stylized illustrations adds a modern and engaging tone.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/4/0/401ecaa00e6cd0305d3ad12930dca10de1f1d13f.jpeg)

thank you. you have no idea how much this helps sir

Once i close my local llm and close the nrgrok URL (after entering the answer
and the answer being correct), the next time I refresh or check the answer in
the Ga2 site, q10 gets marked wrong. I have to redo the entire process for it
to be correct again.

Can you clarify why this is happening?



---

because it dynamically checks the answer each time a submit is done and if the
ngrok tunnel and the service is not running at the time, then it marks it
wrong.

Since every student’s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics
question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit.

The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check
all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before
doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok
tunnel and submit to get the full marks.

Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now
once you got it working. Solve all the other ones first and then for the final
submission “get all your ducks in a row.”

Kind regards

hi [@23f2003853](/u/23f2003853)

I think you are running your application server inside a virtual machine
because of which it doesn’t have visibility to outside world(request coming
from other domains). So you would need to identify ipaddress of your virtual
machine and would need to use that in place of `127.0.0.1`. Take help from GPT
to identify ipaddress of virtual machine.

Hello Sir,

I’ve been working on question 6 and I’m facing this error where the marks are
not ordered properly. I believe my code appends the marks based on the names
that are inputted in the backend but I’m unable to identify the source of this
issue. Please shed some light on the same.

![Here's a description of the image:

The image shows an error message related to a Vercel URL configuration. The message indicates that there's a discrepancy in the input provided compared to what was expected.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Context:** The image displays text suggesting the user is configuring a Vercel application and needs to provide the correct URL. It also prompts the user to enable CORS.
*   **URL Prompt:** The text "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app.vercel.app/api" prompts the user to enter the correct Vercel app URL.
*   **User Input:** Below this, the user has entered "https://new1-ivory.vercel.app/api".
*   **Error Message:** An error message appears below the input, indicating a mismatch in expected values. It shows "Error: Expected \[73,73,53,63,61] but got \[73,53,61,63,73]". This suggests the error might be related to the ASCII values of specific characters in the input.

In summary, the image illustrates a user configuring a Vercel application and encountering an error when providing the application's URL, possibly due to a typo or misunderstanding of the required format.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/8/4/84d6ec605d548610f622bc5a7fa4b8707d345dc3.png)

Hi Shalini,

I deployed my code with your dataset and checked and checked answers for your
dataset, so there is no errors in backend.

Since you are getting some output, it won’t help to look up to logs from
vercel, just check your code if it’s logically correct.

Kind regards

Here is my code. Could you please help me identify any issues or clarify where
I might be going wrong?



![Here is a description of the image:

The image shows Python code for a simple HTTP server that responds to GET requests with data from a JSON file. The code handles CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow requests from any origin. It parses query parameters to extract a 'name' value and then searches for entries in the JSON data that match the provided names. If matches are found, the corresponding 'marks' values from the JSON data are returned in the response. If no matches are found or if the 'name' parameter is missing, an error message is returned. The code also handles OPTIONS requests for CORS preflight checks.

Below this are buttons for "Continue" and "Back to QR Code". A message in smaller font states "ngrok staff will never ask you to enter a code on this page."

In the upper right corner of the screen, a white box with a red 'X' icon is displayed, indicating an error. The message reads: "Error: The information supplied for MFA verification was invalid." This indicates that the code entered was incorrect or invalid.

The web address in the browser's address bar shows "dashboard.ngrok.com/login/mfa/setup", confirming that the user is on the ngrok website's MFA setup page.

At the bottom right of the screenshot, there's a message "Activate Windows. Go to Settings to activate Windows." This indicates that the Windows operating system on the computer is not activated. The date and time are also displayed as 13:31 on 29/01/2025.

![Here's a description of the image, focusing on its content and what it seems to represent:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a screenshot of what appears to be a coding challenge or assignment, likely related to web development or backend programming. The user has achieved a score of 8 out of 10, indicating partial completion or some errors.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Challenge Description:** The image details a task involving deploying a Python application to Vercel (a serverless deployment platform). The core task is to create an API that processes requests containing student names and returns their corresponding marks from a data source (likely a JSON file).
*   **JSON Data:** A snippet of JSON code is provided, showing the expected structure of the API response: `{"marks": [10, 20]}`.
*   **CORS:** The instructions emphasize the importance of enabling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow GET requests from any origin, crucial for the API to be accessible from different domains.
*   **Vercel URL:** The image asks for the Vercel URL of the deployed API. The user has provided `https://vercel-project-three-liard.vercel.app/api` as their answer, but it's marked with an error.
*   **Error Message:** The error message "Expected [35,71,83,96,95] but got [null,null,null,null,null]" suggests that the API is either not returning the correct marks for the expected input names or it is not parsing the request correctly.

**Interpretation:**

The image depicts a user attempting to solve a programming challenge involving creating a simple API to retrieve student marks. The error suggests that the API logic is not correctly fetching and returning the marks for the specified students, implying a problem in data retrieval, request parameter handling, or data structure implementation. The challenge specifically assesses skills in Python development, API creation with Vercel, JSON data handling, and CORS configuration.

*   `uploaded=files.upload()`:  This line executes a file upload operation, likely prompting the user to select a file from their local machine.
*   `image = Image.open(list(uploaded.keys())[0])`: This opens the uploaded image using the PIL library. It assumes that the uploaded file is an image and accesses its name from the `uploaded` dictionary.
*   `rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0`: This converts the image into a NumPy array and normalizes the RGB values to be between 0 and 1.
*   `lightness = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*x)[1], 2, rgb)`: This line calculates the lightness component of each pixel. It applies a lambda function along the last axis (axis=2) of the `rgb` array. The lambda function converts each RGB pixel to HLS (Hue, Lightness, Saturation) format and extracts the lightness component (index 1).
*   `light_pixels = np.sum(lightness >= 0.219)`: This counts the number of pixels in the image that have a lightness value greater than or equal to 0.219.  It uses NumPy's `sum` function to count the `True` values resulting from the boolean comparison.
*   `print(f'Number of pixels with lightness > 0.219: {light_pixels}')`: This prints the calculated number of pixels meeting the lightness condition to the console.

**Execution/Output Section:**

*   Below the code, there's a "Choose Files" button, indicating that the Colab environment is waiting for a file to be uploaded. The uploaded file is "lenna.webp".
*   There's a status message indicating that the file "lenna.webp" has been uploaded successfully. It also gives the file size (14820 bytes) and the last modified date (1/30/2025).
*   Finally, the output of the code is displayed: "Number of pixels with lightness > 0.219: 248985".  This indicates that the code has calculated and printed the result.

In essence, the code takes an image as input, converts its color space to HLS, calculates the lightness of each pixel, and then counts the number of pixels that are brighter than a certain threshold (0.219). The screenshot captures both the code and the output of the program.

![Here's a description of the image you sent:

**Overall:**

The image is a screenshot of a Python code execution environment, likely Google Colab, showing code related to image processing. The code calculates the number of pixels in an image that have a lightness value greater than 0.219. The output of the code is also visible, showing the calculated number of light pixels.

**Code Snippet:**

The Python code imports necessary libraries (NumPy, PIL (Pillow), and colorsys). It uploads an image file ("lenna.webp"), opens it using PIL, converts it to a NumPy array, and normalizes the RGB values. The code then calculates the lightness of each pixel using the `colorsys.rgb_to_hls` function. Finally, it counts and prints the number of pixels with a lightness value greater than 0.219.

**Execution Output:**

The output section indicates that the "lenna.webp" file was successfully uploaded and processed. The code calculated that there are 248985 pixels with a lightness value greater than 0.219 in the image.

could you also give me a hint

I think in Q.6 its some error in your code’s logic its unable to fetch the
data from your code(Even I tried your URL and its just a black page). Make
sure your link is working correctly(giving json response) by pasting it to the
browser.

In Q9. I have created dictionary of given data. You can check the for format
in the given codes just above the question.(see Test with curl api)



---

I think your code logic seem to be correct but it may be because u have
downloaded twice the same image and in your output lenna.webp is saving to
lenna(1).webp.  
Try to do it again after deleting those images which are already downloaded!

I have laready tried doing that as well but it still doesnt seem to work



![Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a Python code snippet executed in Google Colab. The code calculates the number of pixels in an image that have a lightness value greater than 0.219.

**Code Breakdown:**

1.  **Import Libraries:** The code starts by importing necessary libraries: `numpy` (as `np`), `PIL.Image` for image processing, `google.colab.files` for uploading files, and `colorsys` for color conversions.
2.  **File Upload:**  `uploaded = files.upload()` prompts the user to upload a file.
3.  **Image Opening:** `image = Image.open(list(uploaded.keys())[0])` opens the uploaded image using the PIL library. It extracts the filename from the `uploaded` dictionary.
4.  **RGB Conversion:** `rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0` converts the image into a NumPy array of RGB values and normalizes them to the range 0-1.
5.  **Lightness Calculation:**  `lightness = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*x)[1], 2, rgb)` calculates the lightness of each pixel using the `colorsys.rgb_to_hls` function, which converts RGB to Hue, Lightness, Saturation (HLS).  The `apply_along_axis` function applies the lambda function to each pixel (axis 2 of the `rgb` array), and the lambda function extracts the lightness value (index 1) from the HLS tuple.
6.  **Pixel Counting:**  `light_pixels = np.sum(lightness > 0.219)` counts the number of pixels where the lightness value is greater than 0.219. The `lightness > 0.219` creates a boolean array, and `np.sum` treats `True` as 1 and `False` as 0, effectively counting the `True` values.
7.  **Output:**  `print(f'Number of pixels with lightness > 0.219: {light_pixels}')` prints the final count of pixels with the specified lightness.

**Output Below the Code:**

The output shows:

*   `Choose Files lenna.webp`: Indicates the user has uploaded a file named "lenna.webp".
*   `lenna.webp(image/webp) - 14820 bytes, last modified: 1/30/2025 - 100% done`: Confirms the file upload details (file type, size, modification date, upload progress).
*   `Saving lenna.webp to lenna.webp`: Message indicating that the uploaded file is being saved.
*   `Number of pixels with lightness > 0.219: 248985`:  This is the result of the code execution. It states that there are 248985 pixels in the image with a lightness value greater than 0.219.

![Here is a description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of the Vercel dashboard for a production deployment of a project named "jivraj-18s-projects".

**Key elements and observations:**

*   **URL:** The URL visible in the address bar is `https://vercel.com/jivraj-18s-projects/api`. This indicates that the user is likely viewing API-related settings or information for the project.
*   **Navigation:** The top navigation bar shows the following tabs: Project, Deployments, Analytics, Speed Insights, Logs, Observability, Firewall, Storage, and Settings. "Project" is currently selected.
*   **Production Deployment Section:** The main content area shows information about the "Production Deployment."
*   **"Not Found" Error:** On the left side, there is a "Not Found" error message. This suggests that the expected URL was not found on the server.
*   **Deployment Details:** On the right side, there are details about the deployment:
    *   Deployment ID: `api-6xs8fp81c-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app`
    *   Domains: `api-ruby-seven-48.vercel.app` (+2 others likely)
    *   Status: "Ready," indicating the deployment was successful.
    *   Created: "28 Jan by jivraj-18."
*   **Source Code Links:** There are options to view the code and to trigger a "vercel deploy" command.
*   **Build/Runtime Logs:** Buttons for "Build Logs" and "Runtime Logs" are present, suggesting the user can inspect those for troubleshooting.

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a Vercel deployment that is marked as "Ready," but a specific API endpoint is returning a "Not Found" error. This could indicate an issue with the API route configuration, the API code itself, or possibly a caching problem. The user likely needs to investigate the "Not Found" error using the available build and runtime logs, and also review the API route configuration.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/e/a/ea1a1dadad49d6b6665a2366d0902d4a45122b32_2_690x317.png)

The issue might be with the IP address you’re using. Try using `127.0.0.1` and
check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with
`http://localhost:8000/api` to see if it works.

If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a
virtual machine, use the `ipconfig` command to check the correct IP address.

We usually address doubts at the end of every session. Our next session is on
the 31st—you can join then and ask your question if none of above solutions
works.

![Here is a description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of a web browser, specifically showing the developer tools and the output from an API call.

**Left Side (Main Content):**

*   The left side shows the "Pretty-print" of JSON data. The data appears to be an array of objects, where each object represents a student.
*   Each student object has two fields: "studentId" (an integer) and "class" (a string representing the class).
*   The API is returning student IDs and their classes.
*   Some students in the list are listed as belonging to "SN", "1T", "11P", "9W" classes.

**Right Side (Developer Tools - Network Tab):**

*   The right side displays the "Network" tab of the browser's developer tools.
*   There's a filter enabled, probably showing only "Fetch/XHR" requests.
*   A single network request is listed: `api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`. This is the URL that was called to retrieve the JSON data on the left.
*   The request has a "Status" of "200," indicating a successful response.
*   The "Type" is "document", but this can be misleading as the response is actually JSON.
*   The "Size" is 694 B, meaning that the API response was approximately 694 bytes in size.

**Bottom Side (Console):**

*   The console indicates there is one "issue": "A form field element should have an id or name attribute" which is unrelated to the network response shown.

**In Summary:** The image shows an API response (in JSON format) containing student information retrieved from a URL. The developer tools are used to inspect the network request and confirm that it was successful.
](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/7/5/75bfccbd7f4a955274b08239c9183d7c6b3de366_2_690x238.png)


![Here's a description of the image:

**Content:**

*   **Browser Window:** The image shows a Google Chrome browser window. The address bar indicates the URL `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=SN&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`.
*   **Data Display:** The main part of the browser displays a list of JSON-like objects. Each object seems to represent a student with "studentId" and "class" properties. The classes represented are "SN", "1T", "11P", and "9W".
*   **Developer Console:** The Chrome Developer Console is open on the right side of the browser window. The "Console" tab is selected. There are no specific messages in the console.
*   **Issues Panel:** At the bottom, the "Issues" panel is visible. It displays an alert: "A form field element should have an id or name attribute."
*   **Tabs:** There are several other tabs open in the browser, including tabs related to "AQ 4:", "Untitle", "GA2", "Your A", "Vercell", "Viveks", "My Da", "Gradec", "Tools in", "llama.c", "12" and "TDS 20".

**Interpretation:**

The image shows someone accessing an API endpoint (`/api`) on a local development server (`127.0.0.1:8000`). The API endpoint is likely retrieving student data based on class. The data is displayed in the browser window. The developer is likely working on the front-end of an application that uses this API. The issue reported in the issues tab is a typical accessibility-related warning, suggesting that some form fields are missing required attributes.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/6/2/629a7af2183efcbf51bc2d3d8a9b1fc50f252650_2_690x270.png)

![Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a task or instruction set related to deploying a Python application to Vercel. The context is about creating an API that returns the marks of students based on their names.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Top:** There is an instruction to download a `q-vercel-python.json` file, which contains the marks of 100 imaginary students.
*   **Middle:** The next step is to create and deploy a Python app to Vercel. The API should be designed so that a request like `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name-X&name-Y` returns a JSON response containing the marks of student names X and Y. An example of the desired JSON output is provided, showing `"marks": 10 20`.
*   **CORS:** It emphasizes the need to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow GET requests from any origin.
*   **Vercel URL:** It asks for the user's Vercel URL. An example of a valid Vercel URL is shown as: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`. The user has entered a URL but it's highlighted in red, with an error message "TypeError: Failed to fetch." This suggests that the entered URL is either incorrect or there is an issue with the deployment or connectivity of the Vercel app.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/0/0/0057df148250fe0e3884b75aa26841869ef126ae.png)


![Here is a description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of a web browser, likely Google Chrome, with several tabs open. The active tab shows a JSON response from a Vercel project called "tdsproject1." The URL of the page is "tdsproject1-tjsdpi1-23f2003853-projects.vercel.app/api?name=sLrAoQ&name=d2KY". The JSON response appears to be a dictionary containing a single key, "marks", which maps to a list of numbers, specifically [1, 41].  A checkbox labeled "Pretty-print" is present on the page.

you need to keep the services running. Else it will fail. Do whats required,
regenerate that link and paste it once you complete and save it. this way you
can avoid rework.

sir the output im getting after correcting the code is showing incorrect on
the portal

if you could suggest me why is that happening, where am i making an error
because i have cross checked this a lot of times and still am unable to
understand where i might be making a mistake

I had faced the same issue. Please ensure the url is not protected against the
access of third party (IITM will access your url. To check it, try to open the
url in different browser)

Hi sakshi in vercel problem i also had similar error. remove this code if
**name** == ‘**main** ’:

24 # app.run(debug=True) frm your flask app then run it. it worked for me i
found this with the help of chatgpt. vercel has some built in features to run
so this is not required it seems.

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a screenshot of a video call, likely a screen sharing session. Someone named Saransh is presenting code, which appears to be a Python program using the FastAPI framework.

**Content Breakdown:**

*   **Main Window:** The primary focus is on the code editor, displaying a Python file named `fast.py` and a `data.csv` file opened. The Python code seems to define an API endpoint `/api` that takes a list of city names as input and returns the population for a given city from a data set.
*   **Code Snippet:** The code snippet shows that, data is read into a pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_csv("data.csv")`.

    *   An endpoint `/api` is defined.
    *   The population of a city is retrieved.
    *   The API returns the city and its population.
*   **Video Call Interface:** Google Meet video call interface is visible, the name "Saransh" and a profile picture are showing. Buttons for muting, camera control, and ending the call are at the bottom.
*   **Additional Details:**
    *   There are toolbars and application icons visible around the edges of the code editor, indicating a typical IDE (Integrated Development Environment) setup.
    *   The bottom of the screen displays IDE information.

**In summary,** it's a scene from a coding presentation or collaboration session. Saransh is showing Python code related to a simple API that retrieves population data based on city input.

Hi Srividya,

Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its
serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.  
When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.

This renders `name == main` part of the code unnecessary at best, since python
interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the
application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes
have started before it).

In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed
any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to
rethink how your application is designed. You _do not_ create serverless
applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or
MAD-2.

This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to
vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly
help in deploying successful serverless applications.

Thanks for your input.

Kind regards

Questions 9 and 10 require running a development server from my side. Right
now, the questions are marked correct and I’ve saved the assignment. Since the
servers won’t always be running, I hope this won’t cause a problem during

![Here's a description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a web browser window. The main content is two columns of JSON data displayed side-by-side on the website "jsondiff.com".  Each JSON object contains two key-value pairs: "class" and "studentId." The "class" value appears to be a string (e.g., "2W", "4X", "4Z") and the "studentId" value appears to be an integer. It seems the website is being used to compare two similar JSON structures, likely to highlight any differences between them.

**Browser Tabs:**

Across the top, there are multiple browser tabs open, which could indicate the user is in the middle of a software development or testing workflow.

**Overall Impression:**

The image suggests someone is working on data-related tasks, possibly involving data validation, debugging, or comparing two versions of a dataset using JSON format.

![Here's a description of the image you sent, based on the OCR results and visual analysis:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web browser during a software development task.  It shows a graded assignment, a text editor, and developer tools, specifically the "Network" tab, indicating debugging of API requests.

**Key Elements:**

1.  **Assignment Interface:**
    *   The top portion shows a grading system, with a score of 7.5/10.
    *   It has instructions for an API endpoint.  The API should filter students based on the `class` query parameter.
    *   There's a field for the API URL and a "Check" button likely used to validate the API implementation.
    *   An error message is shown: "Response undefined does not match expected...". This suggests a test has failed. The expected response shows a JSON array of student objects.

2.  **Error Message:**
    *   The error message indicates a discrepancy between the expected JSON response and the actual response from the API, and specifically shows the expected JSON format for student data (e.g., `{"studentid":60,"class":"IN"}`).

3.  **Developer Tools (Network Tab):**
    *   The "Network" tab in the developer tools shows API requests.
    *   One request is highlighted, probably to an endpoint like `/api?class=...`. The specific class values seem to be a combination of numbers and letters (e.g., `1N`, `8N`, `8X`, `42`).
    *   The "Preview" or "Response" area of the Network tab displays the JSON response received from the API. This JSON data also appears to contain student ID and class information.

4.  **API URL:**
    *   The assignment text requires implementing a fast API that will take a class as a parameter and return only students in those classes. The API endpoint looks to be `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`

**In summary:**

The developer is working on an API that filters student data based on the class they are in. The automated grading system is testing the API endpoint by sending requests with `class` parameters and comparing the returned JSON to the expected JSON. The current implementation is failing because the response doesn't match the expected format or data. The developer is using the browser's developer tools to inspect the API requests and responses to diagnose the issue.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/3/1/31d574850569f527a4038b80d0171d7b685f9348_2_690x431.jpeg)

Hi [@23f2004644](/u/23f2004644) and [@bhashwar_sengupta](/u/bhashwar_sengupta)
,

You would need to keep all the servers active whenever you click on save
button.



---

Hi [@23f2003853](/u/23f2003853) ,

did you enable cors ? If yes then pls send screenshot of console and network
tab.

Kind regards



---

So if I kept the server running and saved the answer, but after reloading it’s
showing incorrect  
We can’t just keep it running.



---

Hi [@daksh76](/u/daksh76) ,

I didn’t actually used python to solve this particular question. I tried for
some time but it was not working. So I just used
[Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/), for now pls use this.



---

whenever you want to submit your answers by pressing save button at that time
only all servers should must be running.



---

I did that, while running all the severs i saved my answers and it showed
“correct”.  
But after sometime when I re-loaded my answers it showed incorrect.

Hi [@24ds1000082_Vivek](/u/24ds1000082_vivek), [@23f3004114](/u/23f3004114) ,

You guys are not using correct format for response.

    
    
    {
      "students": [
        {
          "studentId": 1,
          "class": "1A"
        },
        {
          "studentId": 2,
          "class": "1B"
        }, ...
      ]
    }
    

This is correct for which have a object with key `students` which is not
present in your response.

kind regards



---

That’s okay, when you click on save answers button just make sure all servers
are running.



---

Yes Hari, most probably that’s what the problem is.
[@23F3002987_J_SRI_BAL](/u/23f3002987_j_sri_bal) Check if cors are enabled.

@ carlton @ Jivraj  
Gentlemen! In GA2 answers, I have a problem.  
Question 10, the ngrok tunnel url was once correct and I saved it . When I
revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect.  
Do I need to do anything else ?  
Secondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect
to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the
answer already saved.  
Third, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously
correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 …it does not work. Could you
kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end?
thanks & regards.

In the ngrok question I was getting that same json error as everybody else
since last 7 days or so. The ngrok link was working fine in browser every time
but. Today i ran the LLama file with `--n-gpu-layers 35` parameter at the end
which makes it run using my laptops graphics card i guess. After i ran LLama
file using this and ngrok later, my link was accepted in the GA 2 and i did
not get any error after that.

![Here's a description of the image, focusing on the relevant information:

**Content:**

The image is a screenshot of a web form where a user is being asked to provide a Vercel URL. An example Vercel URL is provided in the prompt. The user has entered a URL, but there is an error message displayed below.

**Details:**

*   **Button:** A blue "Check" button is displayed.

**Interpretation:**

The system is likely verifying the user-provided URL against a predefined set of criteria or expected values. The error message suggests a mismatch between the expected values represented by the array "[98,92,56,72,17]" and the values obtained from the input, where many resources could not be found.

Try these [@21f3000745](/u/21f3000745)

  1. Download the data file once again and replace it with your current file, then deploy.  
**If this doesn’t work, then:**

  2. Try clicking on Check button once again. There are few cases where due to duplicity or other problems in the data, this bug occurs. The next check will most probably work.
  3. Reload the page, open the Networks Tab in the Inspect menu, click on Fetch/XHR filter button. Next click on check, if this error prompts up, you will get the request the system sent to check your answer. Copy that request and check on localhost.

actually on every reload of page , it generates new data which makes question
so tedious.

So the problem was with the JSON data or you just clicked again on check and
it worked?

i loaded the data again as you said and clicked on check again. then it gave
correct

Hi [@24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ](/u/24ds1000121_ulagaooz) ,

For the **ngrok tunnel** question and any other question requiring a server
URL, make sure to **keep all servers running** when clicking the **Save**
button.

Also, I couldn’t find the **GitHub Pages URL** in your **GA2 response** , and
many answers are unmarked. It seems you **didn’t click the Save button**.

Your current score is **4.5/10**.

![The image is a screenshot of a terminal window in VS Code, running a Python FastAPI application. Here's a breakdown of what's visible:

*   **Title Bar:** The title bar indicates it's VS Code, running a Python 3.12 instance, with the workspace directory named "Fastapi".
*   **Terminal Tabs:** The terminal tab is active, with other tabs visible like "Problems," "Output," "Debug Console," and "Ports."
*   **Output Log:** The terminal displays log messages, indicating the server's startup process.
    *   It shows the application is watching a directory for changes.
    *   Uvicorn (an ASGI server) is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
    *   The reloader and server processes have started.
    *   The application startup is complete.
*   **HTTP Requests:** There are several HTTP requests logged.
    *   A "GET /" request resulted in a 404 "Not Found" error.
    *   A "GET /favicon.ico" request also resulted in a 404 "Not Found" error.
    *   "GET /api" and several "GET /api?class=1A" requests were successful, returning a 200 "OK" status.

In summary, the image shows a FastAPI application running locally, with some successful API requests and a few requests for root and favicon returning 404 errors.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/b/2/b24400365fd76c5cadffeffdfc102b8dd61812be_2_690x215.png)


![Here is a description of the image:

The image shows a web browser window displaying JSON data. The data appears to represent a list of students belonging to class "1A". The URL in the address bar reads "127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=1A", suggesting that the data is being retrieved from a local web server using an API call filtering by class. The JSON data consists of a "students" array, where each object in the array contains a "studentId" and the "class" attribute.

![Here's a description of the image content:

**Content Overview:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a programming assignment or online coding challenge related to building a FastAPI API. The challenge involves creating an endpoint that filters students based on a `class` query parameter.

**Specific Elements:**

*   **Task Description:** The text at the top explains the requirements. If the URL has a query parameter `class`, the API should return only students belonging to those classes. It provides examples like `/api?class=1A` and `/api?class=1A&class=1B`.
*   **CORS Requirement:** The instruction emphasizes enabling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow GET requests from any origin.
*   **API Endpoint Prompt:** It asks for the API URL endpoint for FastAPI and provides a sample URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.
*   **User Input:** There's an input field where the user has entered `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.
*   **Error Message:** Below the input field is an error message: "TypeError: Failed to fetch". This indicates there's a problem with the URL or network connectivity when trying to make a request to that endpoint.
*   **Testing Note:** The text "We'll check by sending a request to this URL with `?class...` added and check if the response matches the data." suggests the system will automatically test the entered URL by adding a query parameter.
*   **"Check" Button:** There is a "Check" button for submitting the answer.

**In summary, the image shows a programming challenge where the user needs to provide a valid FastAPI API endpoint that handles filtering students by class. The presence of the "Failed to fetch" error indicates that the provided URL is either incorrect, unreachable, or has CORS issues.**](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/6/a/6a50cc89a7ecf96749fdfd9f965679452c2b3a54_2_690x225.png)

Hi [@23f2000573](/u/23f2000573) ,

As error mentions to add tag to image.

Adding different tags is like versioning your docker image, image with a
particular tag can be pulled.

For adding tag use

*   **Step 1:** Creating a Docker Hub account and logging in using `podman login docker.io`
*   **Step 2:** Building and running the container using:
    *   `podman build -t py-hello .`
    *   `podman run -it py-hello`
*   **Step 3:** Pushing the container to Docker Hub, instructing the user to replace `$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME` with their Docker Hub username. Command: `podman push py-hello:latest docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello`
*   **Step 4:** Pushing the container with a specific tag (e.g., "dev"). Command: `TAG=dev podman push py-hello docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello:$TAG`

Hi [@24f1002359](/u/24f1002359)

For **Question 10** , ensure that **all servers are running** every time you
submit (click the **Save** button). Since **ngrok generates a new URL each
time it runs** , double-check that the **ngrok URL is correct** before
submitting.

For **Question 9** , did you **enable CORS**? To verify, check your **browser
console** —if CORS is not enabled, you should see an error message indicating
the issue.

![Here's a description of the image, focusing on the key information:

The image shows the console of a web browser's developer tools.  The console displays the following messages:

1.  "starting ajax request to the resource." (source: index.html, line 14)
2.  "ajax request done." (source: index.html, line 29)
3.  A CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error: "Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://google.com/' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource." (source: index.html, line 1)

This indicates that an AJAX request made by the web page to "http://google.com/" was blocked by the browser due to CORS restrictions. The server at google.com did not include the necessary "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header in its response to allow requests from the origin "null" (which usually occurs when opening an HTML file directly from the file system rather than a web server).](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/3/2/329ce069447dd12d66391813c527d25c5d109b2f.png)

![Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a snippet of Python code. It defines a function called `api` that is decorated with `@app.get("/api")`, indicating it's likely part of a web application framework (like FastAPI or Flask) and handles GET requests to the `/api` endpoint.

The function `api` has a single parameter `class_`. This parameter is annotated using `Annotated` with a type hint that specifies it can either be a list of strings (`list[str]`) or `None`. It's also annotated with `Query(alias='class')`, indicating that the parameter should be extracted from the query parameters of the HTTP request and should be aliased as 'class' instead of `class_`. The default value of the parameter is set to `None`.

Hi [@24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ](/u/24ds1000121_ulagaooz) ,

That’s because GitHub protects your email when an external website requests a

![Here's a description of the image based on the provided information:

**Overall Layout**

The image shows a browser window split into two main sections. 

**Left Section (Question/Prompt and Answer)**

*   The left section contains a question related to GitHub Pages URLs, with an example given (https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/).
*   Below the question, there's an input field where the user has entered a URL: "https://ulagaoozhian.github.io/TDS-page/".
*   An error message is displayed, indicating that "24ds1000121@ds.study.iitm.ac.in is not in the response". The error message also includes the raw HTML content of a webpage.

**Right Section (Browser Developer Tools)**

*   The right section displays the browser's developer tools. It's likely in the "Network" tab, showing network requests.
*   There is a request listed for "TDS-page/".
*   The "Preview" tab is selected, and it shows the rendered HTML, displaying "My Model Page" as a heading and "Contact me at: \[email protected]".

**Other Elements**

*   The top of the image shows a timer (01:19:33 left), a score (0/10), and "Check All" and "Save" buttons. This suggests it's part of a test or assessment environment.
*   There are other elements that have developer options enabled such as "Preserve log" and "Disable cache"

**Interpretation**

It appears the user is attempting to provide the correct GitHub Pages URL for a project. The error message suggests that the content being served at the provided URL doesn't contain a specific email address. The HTML snippet included with the error is the likely contents being served from the project.

![Here's a description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of text that appears to be instructions and feedback related to an API (likely for a coding challenge or assignment). Here's a breakdown:

**Context/Instructions**

*   The initial text describes how the API should handle the `class` query parameter in the URL. If a `class` parameter is provided, the API should only return student data for the specified class(es). Multiple classes can be specified (e.g., `class=1A&class=1B`).
*   It emphasizes that the order of students in the CSV file should be preserved in the API response, regardless of class.
*   The text stresses the importance of enabling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow GET requests from any origin.
*   It asks the question: "What is the API URL endpoint for FastAPI? It might look like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api"

**API Endpoint:**

*   The line `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` is provided as an example of a possible API endpoint.

**Error Message:**

*   A large block of text is presented as an "Error: Response". This indicates that a test was run against the API endpoint, and the response didn't match the expected output.
*   The response is a JSON-like array of student objects, where each student has a `studentid` and `class`.
*   The error message further states "does not match expected" which suggests that it's an assertion error between the code submission and the expected values.

**Testing**

*   The final sentence explains that testing involves sending a request to the API URL with the `?class=...` parameter and verifying the returned data.

In summary, the image displays a description of the expected behavior of a FastAPI API endpoint related to student data filtering by class, and a subsequent test failure related to the API.](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/a/6/a65a73e26776aa7f03943523ae128705930fa05e_2_690x243.png)


![The image shows a JSON array named "students", where each element is a JSON object representing a student with two properties: "studentId" (an integer) and "class" (a string). The image seems to capture a snippet of a webpage displaying this JSON data in a "Pretty-print" format, likely for readability. The data contains information for 252 students with their respective class assignments.

![Here is a description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of a web browser window, specifically a browser displaying JSON data.  The browser is likely Chrome or a similar Chromium-based browser, judging by the icons. The address bar shows the URL `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=3Q`, indicating a local development server serving an API endpoint. The data being returned is a JSON object with a single key, "students", which contains an array of student objects. Each student object has "studentId" and "class" fields. All the student objects in the sample shown have "class" equal to "3Q". The screenshot also shows other tabs open in the browser, including tabs for Docker, Google Tasks, online learning resources, coding platforms and a website. The bottom of the screenshot captures the Windows taskbar, which shows icons for various applications and the system tray with indicators for CPU usage, GPU usage, RAM usage, and date/time.

Gentleman,  
Will you consider my mark or not ?



---

Gentleman,  
I dont understand. I just now, on triggering the Github action, I copied the
url of my github repository. It worked !



---

The problem is that, if class param is passed, only then it is filtering as
usual, but when no param is passed it returns the entire DataFrame, which is
not supposed to happen.

If no parameter is passed it should return an empty list.

I suspect you directly copied this code from ChatGPT without understanding,
which is acceptable for us, but not very helpful for you.

I had submitted the assignment in the evening, but now in the portal it’s
showing not submitted.

Additionally, the webpage lists several potential causes for difficulties in accessing the graded assignment. These include ad blockers, cookie blocking, disabled JavaScript, use of non-recommended browsers, browser extensions, and overly aggressive anti-virus software.

The webpage also emphasizes that students MUST use their Student ID (eg. 22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) for the Graded Assignment, otherwise, their score will not be considered for evaluation.

Finally, it provides a link to the Graded Assignment 2: "https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga2", encouraging students to attempt it.

same problem, please sir [@carlton](/u/carlton) consider this GA marks
otherwise our efforts will be wasted

We have removed that button, cause it was causing confusion among the
students.

If you have saved your answers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you
will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on
the TDS portal.

Regards,

Yes. The scores you achieve in the TDS portal are your scores for the GA. It’s
not necessary to do anything on the Seek Portal.
